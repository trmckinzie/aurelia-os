# ⚛️ Thinking Tool

**🔗 Related:**

---

### 💡 Definition
> A thinking tool is a deliberately designed conceptual device—such as a distinction, model, [[Heuristic]], or thought experiment—used to improve reasoning, clarify concepts, and avoid systematic errors in understanding.

### 📝 Key Insight
* Thinking tools shape _how_ we reason, not just _what_ we think, by constraining [[Intuition]] and guiding attention to relevant structure.
- An [[Intuition Pump]] is a specific kind of thinking tool: a thought experiment engineered to retrain intuition rather than to serve as a formal proof.
- Effective thinking tools replace vague or misleading mental shortcuts with clearer, more disciplined ways of analyzing complex ideas.
