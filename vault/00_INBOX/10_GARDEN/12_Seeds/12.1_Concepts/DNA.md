### 💡 Definition
> DNA is the molecular medium of heredity that stores, transmits, and enables the expression of genetic information through sequences of nucleotide bases. 

### 📝 Key Insight
* DNA functions as a **[[Replicator]]**: its capacity for high-fidelity copying with occasional variation makes [[Natural Selection]] possible.
- Information in DNA is **context-dependent**—[[Gene]] influence traits through interaction with developmental processes and environments, not as fixed blueprints.
- The structure of DNA (double helix, complementary base pairing) explains both **stability** across generations and **[[variation]]**, the raw material of [[Evolution]].
