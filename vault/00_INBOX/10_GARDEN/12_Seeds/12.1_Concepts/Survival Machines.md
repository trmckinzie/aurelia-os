# ⚛️ Survival Machines

**🔗 Related:**

---

### 💡 Definition
> Survival machines are organisms understood as temporary vehicles constructed by[[Gene]] to protect themselves and promote their replication in a given environment.

### 📝 Key Insight
* Organisms are not the ultimate beneficiaries of [[Evolution]]; they are expendable structures that genes use to persist across generations.
- The design of a survival machine reflects historical selection pressures, producing adaptations that increase a gene’s chances of replication, not conscious goals.
- This framing encourages [[Non-Teleological Process]] thinking by explaining apparent purpose in biology as the outcome of cumulative, blind selection rather than intention ([[Crane]]).
