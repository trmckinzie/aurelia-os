### 💡 Definition
>  The fundamental physical and functional unit of heredity. A specific sequence of nucleotides in DNA (or RNA) that encodes instructions for building proteins or regulating other genes.

### 📝 Key Insight
* The Fundamental Unit of Selection: Evolution does not select for species or even individuals (which die); it selects for genes. Genes are the only things that persist across deep time by making copies of themselves. 
* **Information vs. Hardware:** A gene is not just the physical molecule; it is the *information* contained in the sequence. The physical DNA strand in your body will rot, but the "Gene" (the sequence) survives in your offspring.
