# ⚛️ Heuristic

### 💡 Definition
> A mental shortcut or "rule of thumb" used to solve problems and make judgments quickly and efficiently. Unlike an **algorithm**, which follows a strict step-by-step procedure to guarantee a correct solution, a heuristic is a loose strategy that trades optimality for speed. In cognitive science, heuristics are the operating software of **System 1** thinking—fast, automatic, and computationally cheap methods evolved to navigate a complex environment with limited brainpower.

### 📝 Key Insight
* **Feature, Not a Bug:** While often discussed in the context of "biases" and "errors" (e.g., Kahneman & Tversky), heuristics are actually adaptations for **Ecological Rationality**. Evolution does not optimize for "truth" or "perfect logic"; it optimizes for survival and energy efficiency. Heuristics allow an organism to make life-saving decisions under conditions of uncertainty and time pressure where a full algorithmic calculation would be too slow or metabolically expensive (e.g., the "Gaze Heuristic" used to catch a ball or prey).
