# ⚛️ Intuition Pump

**🔗 Related:**[[Feynman Technique]] [[Thinking Tool]] [[Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking]]

---

### 💡 Definition
> A deliberately crafted thought experiment designed to guide intuition toward a clearer understanding of a concept by stripping away confusion and highlighting the underlying mechanism.

### 📝 Key Insight
* Intuition pumps are not proofs; they are cognitive tools meant to _retrain_ intuition, not replace argumentation.
- Good intuition pumps replace misleading metaphors ([[Skyhook]]) with mechanistic explanations ([[Crane]]). 
- They are especially powerful in philosophy of mind, where everyday intuitions are often unreliable or confused.
