# ⚛️ Non-Teleological Process

**🔗 Related:** [[Natural Selection]]

---

### 💡 Definition
>A system or mechanism that generates complexity without a pre-existing goal, purpose, or blueprint. It operates blindly through immediate cause-and-effect rather than working toward a future "final state" (*telos*).

### 📝 Key Insight
* In the context of [[Evolution]] : replicators are an accident, yet through cumulative improvements constrained by natural selection (which includes competition with other replicators) we observe brilliant biological design 
* Evolution looks like engineering, but it has no foresight. It does not plan for the future; it only selects for what works *right now*.
* The "Why" Fallacy: Asking "what is the purpose of a mosquito?" is a category error. There is no purpose, only the mechanical result of ancestral survival.
