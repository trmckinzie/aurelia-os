# 👤 Daniel Kahneman

### 📝 Profile & Context
> A psychologist who won the Nobel Prize in Economics (2002) for integrating insights from psychology into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty. Along with his longtime collaborator **Amos Tversky**, Kahneman challenged the prevailing assumption that humans are rational actors (_Homo Economicus_) who maximize utility. Instead, he demonstrated that the human mind is governed by two distinct operating systems (System 1 & 2) and relies on "Heuristics" (shortcuts) that lead to predictable, systematic errors (Biases). He is effectively the **Chief Quality Assurance Engineer** of the human mind.

### 📚 Key Works (In Vault)
- [[Thinking, Fast and Slow]] (The synthesis of his career).
- [[Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgment]] (Differentiating between "Bias" and random variability).
- [[Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases]] (The academic foundation).

### ⚛️ Core Concepts
- **[[System 1 vs System 2]]:** The dual-process theory. **System 1** is fast, automatic, emotional, and cheap (energy-wise). **System 2** is slow, effortful, logical, and expensive. Most errors occur because System 1 runs the show while System 2 sleeps.
- **[[Prospect Theory]]:** The model that replaced Expected Utility Theory. It shows that people value gains and losses differently. specifically, **Loss Aversion** (losses hurt roughly 2x more than equivalent gains feel good).
- **[[WYSIATI]] (What You See Is All There Is):** The cognitive mechanism where the mind forms judgments based _only_ on the information currently available, completely ignoring missing evidence (unknown unknowns).
- **[[Peak-End Rule]]:** The psychological heuristic where an experience is judged not by the total sum of pleasure/pain, but by how it felt at its _peak_ and at its _end_.
