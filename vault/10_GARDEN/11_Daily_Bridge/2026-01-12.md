## 📚 KNOWLEDGE INTAKE
*Process your Cornell Notes here. 15 mins max.*

**SOURCE:** [[A Brief History of Intelligence]] by [[Max Bennett]]

**⚛️ ATOMIC EXTRACTION (Cues -> Links):**
* **Concept:** [[Neocortex]]
* **Concept:** [[Neural Dark Ages]]
* **Concept:** [[Warm Blooded]]

**📝 BRIEF SUMMARY:**
>From early vertebrates to early reptiles, a large amount of biological diversity emerged on the earth through the long process of [[Evolution]]. Although the bodies of these organisms were vastly diverse, their brains remained remarkably similar until the evolutionary innovation of the neocortex in early mammals. This newly evolved [[Brain]] structure enabled early mammals to be able to simulate or imagine future scenarios which leads to more intelligent decision making and increased fitness. Simulation can be thought of as learning by imagining or learning before doing as opposed to [[Reinforcement Learning]] which is learning by doing.
