## 🎯 THE MISSION (Float Block)
*The single 30-60 min Deep Work Goal (Reading/Writing).*
**GOAL:** Read Chapter 2 of Selfish Gene (Replicators)
**AI CONTEXT:** `NEWTASK: []

---

## 📚 KNOWLEDGE INTAKE
*Process your Cornell Notes here. 15 mins max.*

**SOURCE:** [[The Selfish Gene]]

**⚛️ ATOMIC EXTRACTION (Cues -> Links):**
* **Concept:** [[10_GARDEN/12_Seeds/12.1_Concepts/Natural Selection]]
* **Concept:** [[Gene]]
* **Concept:** [[Non-Teleological Process]]

**📝 BRIEF SUMMARY:**
>Natural physical processes led to stability in early molecules, then replicators that evolved by natural selection which favors fecundity (speed), longevity (lifespan), and high fidelity (accuracy). This process is cumulative which drives complexity and leads to the development of more effective strategies for survival. Eventually this process led to DNA, which is a complex replicator molecule and a gene is a segment of DNA that generally holds specific instructions for building cells.
