## 📚 KNOWLEDGE INTAKE
*Process your Cornell Notes here. 15 mins max.*

**SOURCE:** [[Huberman Lab Podcast]] by [[Andrew Huberman]] with [[Cal Newport]]

**⚛️ ATOMIC EXTRACTION (Cues -> Links):**
* **Concept:** [[Pull Based Workload Management]]
* **Concept:** [[Multi-Scale Planning]]
* **Concept:** [[Shutdown Ritual]]
* **Concept:** [[Time Blocking]]

**📝 BRIEF SUMMARY:**
>I will now use the pull based work management system and I will provide my admins with a live doc showing the tasks that I am currently working on with the ordered queue. This provides transparency, increases productivity, and reduces time spent communicating progress. This system is highly effective if I am willing to stick to time-blocks, order the queue based on multi-scale planning/prioritization, and by performing a shutdown ritual to close the loop on work from the day.
