## 📚 KNOWLEDGE INTAKE

**SOURCE:** [[Waking Up App]] by [[Sam Harris]]

**⚛️ ATOMIC EXTRACTION (Cues -> Links):**
* **Concept:** [[Do Fewer Things]]
* **Concept:** [[Work at a Natural Pace]]
* **Concept:** [[Obsess Over Quality]]

**📝 BRIEF SUMMARY:**
>Sam and Cal discuss various topics including social media use, well-being, and their predictions of how AI will transform the workforce economy and the knowledge work sector in particular. Cal urges us to follow his 3 step framework for achieving slow productivity, so that we can enjoy our work and be proud of it while still following through with commitments. [[Slow Productivity]] is now definitely on my reading list! As someone who wants to be a writer and creative, these ideas directly apply to me and will help me achieve a balance between a life well lived and a healthy amount of productive output in my career and personal work.
