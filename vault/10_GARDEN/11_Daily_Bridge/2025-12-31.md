**SOURCE:** [[A Brief History of Intelligence]] by [[Max Bennett]]

**⚛️ ATOMIC EXTRACTION (Cues -> Links):**
* **Concept:** [[Valence]]
* **Concept:** [[Associative Learning]]
* **Concept:** [[Credit Assignment Problem]]

**📝 BRIEF SUMMARY:**
>The 1st major breakthrough of intelligence in biological organisms was the discovery of steering. Steering intelligently involves being able to assign valence to stimuli, learning through association, and solving the credit assignment problem. This problem is solved when a learning machine or agent is able to accurately credit the correct action/event that was responsible for producing a certain outcome. What defines an outcome as successful is context dependent, where the focus should be on what counts as successful based on the context of a dynamic agent-environment relationship.
