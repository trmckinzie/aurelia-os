## 📚 KNOWLEDGE INTAKE
*Process your Cornell Notes here. 15 mins max.*

**SOURCE:** Contemplation by me...[[Travis R McKinzie]] 

**⚛️ ATOMIC EXTRACTION (Cues -> Links):**
* **Concept:** [[Atelic]]
* **Concept:** [[Telic]]
* **Concept:** [[Mortality]]
* **Concept**: [[Wisdom]]

**📝 BRIEF SUMMARY:**
>I am aware of my mortality. I am going to be intentional with the finite amount of time and attention I have. I know I will die, and that gives me permission to live. Where am I going? When will I arrive? These questions are meaningless. I am always right where I am at. I is not my ego self, it is the state of non dual awareness filtered through my human experience / mind / brain.
