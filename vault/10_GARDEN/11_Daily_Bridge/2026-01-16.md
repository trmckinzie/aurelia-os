## 🎯 THE MISSION (Float Block)
*The single 30-60 min Deep Work Goal (Reading/Writing).*
**GOAL:** Active Recall from 8 pages of A Brief Hist of Intelligence. Specifically a section that discusses neocortical structure and function.

## 📚 KNOWLEDGE INTAKE
*Process your Cornell Notes here. 15 mins max.*

**SOURCE:** [[A Brief History of Intelligence]] by [[Max Bennett]]

**⚛️ ATOMIC EXTRACTION (Cues -> Links):**
* **Concept:** [[Vertical Alignment of Neocortex]]
* **Concept:** [[Vertical Connectivity of Neocortex]]
* **Concept:** [[Uniform Structure of Neocortex]]
* Concept: [[Perceptual Inference]]

**📝 BRIEF SUMMARY:**
>The neocortex has a uniform structure which is intuitively perplexing because it is responsible for various different functions. Mountcastle realized that the vertical alignment, vertical connectivity, and observed similarity of the neocortex implies that the neocortex is made up of repeating and duplicated microcircuits which he called the neocortical column. The neocortex does not perform different computations it simply receives different inputs and sends outputs to different places based on its location. This means that the auditory and visual cortex is interchangeable (ferret studies). The neocortical column is prewired to perform specific computations : perception through transduction. Helmholtz then theorized that we only perceive what the brain infers. This inference is based on sensory input (limited info), that is then converted into a more complete perceptual experience.
