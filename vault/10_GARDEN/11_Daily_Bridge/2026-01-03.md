## 📚 KNOWLEDGE INTAKE
*Process your Cornell Notes here. 15 mins max.*

**SOURCE:** [[A Brief History of Intelligence]]

**⚛️ ATOMIC EXTRACTION (Cues -> Links):**
* **Concept:** [[Reinforcement Learning]]
* **Concept:** [[Dopamine]]
* **Concept:** [[Basal Ganglia]]
* **Concept:** [[Temporal Difference Learning]]
* **Concept:** [[Hippocampus]]

**📝 BRIEF SUMMARY:**
>Reinforcement learning in early vertebrates was made possible through the mechanisms of valence and associative learning. These mechanisms evolved prior in early bilaterians. Reinforcement Learning is bootstrapped on simpler valence signals of "good and bad". 

>Conceptually the vertebrate brain is built on top of the more ancient steering systems of early bilaterians. Without steering, there is no starting point for trial and error, no foundation on which to measure which actions/events to reinforce or un-reinforce.
