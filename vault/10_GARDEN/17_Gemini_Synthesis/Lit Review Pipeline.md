## 🧬 Core Principle

The Literature Review as a Crane:

A literature review is not a summary of existing text; it is a topological map of the knowledge boundary. Its primary function is to empirically demonstrate a "gap" in the current evolutionary landscape of ideas, justifying the necessity of a new contribution. It avoids "skyhooks" (unsupported claims) by building a mechanistic data pipeline.

## 🏗️ The Architecture (ETL Pipeline)

### 1. INPUT LAYER: Discovery (Signal Capture)

- **Goal:** Maximize high-fitness memes (cited ideas); filter noise.
    
- **Tools:** Google Scholar $\to$ Zotero.
    
- **Protocol:**
    
    - **Filter:** High citation counts + recent date ranges (last 5-10 years).
        
    - **Capture:** Use Zotero Connector for instant metadata/PDF scraping.
        
    - **Taxonomy:** Organize by _Concept/Phenomenon_ (e.g., "Mismatched Environment"), not by title or author.
        

### 2. PROCESSING LAYER: Ingestion (The Socratic Loop)

- **Goal:** Rapid extraction of axioms and methodology without cognitive burnout.
    
- **Tools:** Zotero PDFs $\to$ Notebook LM.
    
- **Protocol:**
    
    - **Interrogation:** Do not read passively. Query the Notebook for axioms, methodological limitations, and definitions.
        
    - **Extraction:** Move atomic insights (with citations) into a "Synthesis Buffer."
        

### 3. LOGIC LAYER: Synthesis (The Matrix)

- **Goal:** Convert linear summaries into a network of conflicting/converging ideas.
    
- **Tools:** Notebook LM $\to$ Google Docs (Table).
    
- **Protocol:**
    
    - **The Matrix:** Create a comparison table (Rows = Concepts, Columns = Papers).
        
    - **Gap Finding:** Visually identify where cells disagree (Conflict) or are empty (The Gap).
        

### 4. OUTPUT LAYER: Production (The Argument)

- **Goal:** High-clarity prose constructed via the "Funnel Method."
    
- **Tools:** Google Docs + Zotero Plugin.
    
- **Protocol:**
    
    - **Structure:** Context $\to$ Problem $\to$ Current Solutions $\to$ Failure of Solutions $\to$ **The Gap (Your Contribution)**.
        
    - **Citation:** Algorithmic insertion via Zotero Plugin to ensure strict APA compliance.
