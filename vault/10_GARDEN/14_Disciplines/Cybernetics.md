# ⚙️ Cybernetics

### 🧐 Definition (The Scope)

> The transdisciplinary study of **Control** and **Communication** in the animal and the machine. Coined by **Norbert Wiener** in 1948 (from the Greek _kybernetes_, meaning "steersman"—the same root as "governor" and "Kubernetes"). Unlike linear science (A causes B), Cybernetics studies **Circular Causality** (A causes B, which causes A). It treats biological organisms, social systems, and mechanical robots as fundamentally similar "machines" that use **[[Feedback Loops]]** to achieve goals and maintain stability (Homeostasis) against the forces of [[Entropy]].

### 🔑 Core Concepts (The Bricks)

- **[[Feedback Loops]]:** The mechanism by which a system adjusts its output based on past results.
    
    - **[[Negative Feedback]]:** Counteracts deviation to maintain stability (e.g., A thermostat, The body regulating temperature, A Stoic correcting an emotion).
        
    - **[[Positive Feedback]]:** Amplifies deviation to drive growth or collapse (e.g., A bank run, Audio screeching, Compound interest).
        
- **[[Entropy]] & Information:** Cybernetics views the universe as a battle against Entropy (disorder). **[[Information]]** is the opposite of entropy (it is [["negentropy]]"). Systems survive by processing information to retard the natural slide into chaos.
- **[[Homeostasis]]:** The ability of a system to maintain internal stability despite external turbulence. In engineering, this is "equilibrium"; in biology, it is "survival."
- **[[Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety]]:** "Only variety can destroy variety." To control a complex system (like a market or an ecosystem), the controlling system (the manager or algorithm) must have at least as many states (options/responses) as the system it is trying to control.
    

### 📚 Foundational Texts

- **[[Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine]]** by **[[Norbert Wiene]]r** (The founding manifesto).
- **[[An Introduction to Cybernetics]]** by **W. Ross Ashby** (The rigorous textbook).
- **[[The Human Use of Human Beings]]** by **Norbert Wiener** (The philosophical/social implications).
- **[[Steps to an Ecology of Mind]]** by **Gregory Bateson** (Applying cybernetics to anthropology and psychiatry).

### 🧪 Unresolved Questions
- The Alignment Problem: If we build cybernetic systems (AI) that optimize for a goal using feedback, how do we ensure the goal doesn't drift or produce catastrophic side effects (Positive Feedback Loops)?
- Second-Order Cybernetics: Can an observer (scientist) ever truly be objective, or are they inevitably part of the cybernetic loop of the system they are observing?
