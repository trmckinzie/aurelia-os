# 🧠 Cognitive Science

### 🧐 Definition (The Scope)
>The interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes. Unlike Psychology, which focuses on human behavior, Cognitive Science views "intelligence" as a form of **Information Processing** that can be realized in various substrates (brains, computers, or theoretical Turing machines). It sits at the intersection of six fields: **Neuroscience**, **Computer Science (AI)**, **Psychology**, **Linguistics**, **Philosophy**, and **Anthropology**. Its central dogma is the **Computational Theory of Mind**: the idea that the mind is to the brain what software is to hardware.

### 🔑 Core Concepts (The Bricks)
- **[[Marr's Levels of Analysis]]:** The framework for understanding any information processing system: 1. **Computational** (What is the goal?), 2. **Algorithmic** (What is the software/process?), 3. **Implementation** (What is the hardware/biology?).
- **[[Connectionism vs. Symbolism]]:** The great civil war of the field. Is the mind a "Symbol Manipulator" (Logic/GOFAI) or a "Pattern Associator" (Neural Networks/Parallel Distributed Processing)?
- **[[Modularity of Mind]]:** The theory (Jerry Fodor) that the mind is not a single general-purpose computer, but a collection of specialized, encapsulated "apps" or modules (e.g., face recognition, language acquisition) evolved to solve specific problems.
- **[[Embodied Cognition]]:** The counter-argument that intelligence cannot exist in a vacuum; it requires a body interacting with an environment to provide "grounding" for its concepts.

### 📚 Foundational Texts
- [[Vision]] by **David Marr** (The bible of computational neuroscience).
- **[[The Society of Mind]]** by **Marvin Minsky** (The theory that intelligence emerges from the interaction of many non-intelligent agents).
- **[[Vehicles]]** by **Valentino Braitenberg** (Thought experiments on how complex behavior emerges from simple sensor-motor connections).
- **[[Kinds of Minds]]** by [[Daniel Dennett]] (The intentional stance and the evolution of understanding).
- [[How the Mind Works]] by [[Steven Pinker]]
### 🧪 Unresolved Questions
- The Symbol Grounding Problem: How do internal symbols (like the binary code for "apple") get their meaning without referencing other symbols?
- The Binding Problem: How does the brain segregate elements in complex patterns (shape, color, motion) and then bind them back together into a unified conscious object?
- AGI Alignment: Can a cognitive architecture be built that is super intelligent yet retains human-compatible values without biological drives?
