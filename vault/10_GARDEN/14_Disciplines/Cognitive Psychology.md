# 🧠 Cognitive Psychology

### 🧐 Definition (The Scope)
>The scientific study of mental processes such as "attention, language use, memory, perception, problem solving, creativity, and thinking."

**The Revolution:** It emerged in the 1950s as a reaction against **Behaviorism** (which treated the mind as a "Black Box" that couldn't be studied). Cognitive Psychology opened the box, adopting the **Information Processing Metaphor**: it views the mind as a computer that takes input (Sensation), executes algorithms (Cognition), and produces output (Behavior).

### 🔑 Core Concepts (The Bricks)
- **[[Information Processing Model]]:** The foundational paradigm. It breaks thinking down into steps:
    
    - _Encoding_ (Input) $\rightarrow$ _Storage_ (Processing) $\rightarrow$ _Retrieval_ (Output).
        
    - Just like a computer, the system is limited by bandwidth (Attention) and hard drive space (Long-term Memory).
        
- **[[Working Memory]]:** The "RAM" of the human mind. Defined famously by **George Miller's Law** ($7 \pm 2$), it implies we can only hold a tiny amount of information active at one time. This bottleneck is why we need tools (like writing) to think complex thoughts.
    
- **[[Schema Theory]]:** The mental structures or "frameworks" we use to organize knowledge. We don't store facts in isolation; we store them in web-like clusters. Learning is the act of slotting new information into an existing schema (Assimilation) or changing the schema to fit new information (Accommodation).
    
- **[[Dual Process Theory]]:** The distinction between **System 1** (Fast, Intuitive, Emotional) and **System 2** (Slow, Deliberate, Logical). This is the bridge to your notes on _The Righteous Mind_ (Elephant vs. Rider).

### 📚 Foundational Texts
- **[[Cognitive Psychology]]** by **Ulric Neisser** (The 1967 book that named and defined the field).
    
- **[[]]** by **[[Daniel Kahneman]]** (The encyclopedia of cognitive biases).
    
- **[[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two]]** by **George Miller** (The paper that quantified our cognitive limits).
    
- **[[Baddeley's Model of Working Memory]]** (The structural map of the short-term mind).

### 🧪 Unresolved Questions
- The Replication Crisis: Many famous cognitive psychology experiments (like "Ego Depletion" or "Priming") have failed to replicate in recent years. How much of the "textbook" knowledge is actually statistical noise?
    
- Embodied Cognition: Is the mind strictly software running in the brain, or is thinking "distributed" throughout the body and the environment? (e.g., using fingers to count or a notebook to remember).
