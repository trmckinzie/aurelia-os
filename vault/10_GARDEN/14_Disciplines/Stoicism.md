# 🏛️ Stoicism

### 🧐 Definition (The Scope)
> A Hellenistic school of philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium (c. 300 BC), designed to produce **Eudaimonia** (human flourishing) through the cultivation of **Virtue** (Excellence of Character). Unlike modern definitions of "stoicism" (suppressing emotion), the ancient philosophy is about _domestication_ of emotion through reason. It views philosophy as a practice consisting of three interconnected disciplines: **Physics** (understanding how the world works/nature), **Logic** (how to think clearly), and **Ethics** (how to live). It asserts that the only true good is a virtuous character, as it is the only thing that cannot be used for evil.

### 🔑 Core Concepts (The Bricks)
- **[[The Dichotomy of Control]]:** The foundational algorithm. Divide all events into "Internal" (Volition/Judgments) and "External" (Body/Wealth/Reputation). Tie your self-worth only to the former.
- **[[Prohairesis]] (Moral Will):** The faculty of choice. It is the only thing that is truly "ours." A Stoic’s goal is to keep their Prohairesis in harmony with nature.
- **[[Premeditatio Malorum]]:** (Negative Visualization). The practice of rehearsing worst-case scenarios (poverty, exile, death) to reduce fear and increase gratitude for the present. "He who has anticipated the coming of troubles takes away their power when they arrive."
- **[[Sympatheia]]:** Cosmic affinity. The belief that the universe is a unified organism and humans are individual cells within it, creating a duty to act for the common good.
- **[[Amor Fati]]:** (Love of Fate). The active embrace of whatever happens—treating every event, good or bad, as necessary material for the exercise of virtue.

### 📚 Foundational Texts
- **[[Meditations]]** by **Marcus Aurelius** (The Sovereign Application).
- **[[Enchiridion]]** & **[[Discourses]]** by **Epictetus** (The Technical Manual).
- **[[Letters from a Stoic]]** by **Seneca** (The Practical Essays).
- **[[The Daily Stoic]]** by **Ryan Holiday** (Modern synthesis).
### 🧪 Unresolved Questions
- The Problem of Determinism: If the universe is governed by Logos (Fate), does true Free Will exist, or is our "choice" merely to accept the script willingly?
- The "Stone" Critique: Does the goal of Apatheia (freedom from passion) risk turning a human into an unfeeling statue, detached from the love and grief that define the human experience?
