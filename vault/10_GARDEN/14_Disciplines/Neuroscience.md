# 🧠 Neuroscience

### 🧐 Definition (The Scope)
>The scientific study of the nervous system. If Cognitive Science is the study of the "Software" (Mind), Neuroscience is the study of the "Hardware" (Brain). It is a multidisciplinary field that ranges from **Molecular Biology** (ion channels and proteins) to **Systems Neuroscience** (neural circuits and architecture) to **Behavioral Neuroscience** (how firing patterns create action). Its ultimate goal is to reverse-engineer the biological machinery that produces consciousness, memory, and intelligence.

### 🔑 Core Concepts (The Bricks)
- **[[Action Potential]]:** The fundamental unit of communication. An "all-or-nothing" electrical spike that travels down the axon. It is the biological equivalent of a binary signal (1 or 0), though significantly more complex due to temporal coding.
- **[[Synaptic Plasticity]] (Hebbian Learning):** The mechanism of memory. Summarized by the axiom: _"Cells that fire together, wire together."_ When two neurons activate simultaneously, the connection (synapse) between them strengthens (Long-Term Potentiation), making it easier for one to activate the other in the future.
- **[[Lateral Inhibition]]:** A signal processing technique where an excited neuron reduces the activity of its neighbors. This creates "contrast" in sensory processing, allowing the brain to detect edges and sharp boundaries in the environment.
- **[[Neurotransmitters]]:** The chemical messengers (e.g., Dopamine, Serotonin, Glutamate) that transmit signals across the synapse. They act as "modulators" or "gain control," altering the probability that a neuron will fire.
### 📚 Foundational Texts
- **[[Principles of Neural Science]]** by **Eric Kandel** (The absolute "Bible" of the field).
- **[[Behave]]** by **Robert Sapolsky** (The integration of neurology, endocrinology, and evolution).
- **[[The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat]]** by **Oliver Sacks** (Case studies on hardware failure).   
- **[[On Intelligence]]** by **Jeff Hawkins** (A theoretical framework for cortical function).
### 🧪 Unresolved Questions
- The Neural Code: We know how a single neuron fires, but we still don't fully understand the "syntax" of how millions of neurons represent a complex concept like "Justice" or "Grandmother."
- The Hard Problem of Consciousness: How does physical matter (ions flowing across membranes) give rise to subjective experience (Qualia)?
- Connectomics: Can we map the trillions of synaptic connections in a human brain, and if we simulated that map, would it be conscious?
