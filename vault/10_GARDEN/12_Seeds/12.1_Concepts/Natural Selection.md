### 💡 Definition
> The differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype. It is the passive mechanical process where traits that enhance survival in a specific environment increase in frequency over generations.

### 📝 Key Insight
* Natural selection cannot create new traits; it only acts as a filter on random variations (mutations) that already exist. It edits the gene pool rather than writing it. * 
* Context is King: No trait is inherently "superior." A trait (like heavy fur) is only advantageous relative to a specific environment (cold weather). If the environment changes, the "best" traits change immediately.
