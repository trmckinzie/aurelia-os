### 💡 Definition
> A crane is a legitimate, step-by-step explanatory mechanism that builds complexity from simpler components without invoking mystery, purpose, or supernatural intervention.

### 📝 Key Insight
* Cranes contrast with “[[Skyhook]],” which falsely explain complexity by appealing to unexplained intelligence or magic.
- Darwinian [[Natural Selection]] is Dennett’s paradigmatic crane: a blind, cumulative process capable of producing design-like outcomes. [[Non-Teleological Process]]
- Using cranes forces explanations to remain mechanistic, historical, and testable, disciplining intuition and preventing metaphysical shortcuts.
