### 💡 Definition
> A finite, deterministic sequence of well-defined instructions designed to perform a specific task or solve a class of problems. In the context of **Evolutionary Naturalism**, an algorithm is a "recipe that works without a chef"—a mindless process that, if followed faithfully, guarantees a result. It is **substrate-neutral**, meaning the logic of the algorithm remains valid whether it is executed on silicon chips, written on paper, or instantiated in biological [[neural network]]s.

### 📝 Key Insight
- **The Universal Acid:** As described by [[Daniel Dennett]], the most powerful insight is that **[[Natural Selection]] itself is an algorithm**. It is a process of [[variation]], Selection, and [[Heredity]] that generates design without a designer. This implies that intelligence, life, and consciousness are not "magic" ([[Skyhook]]s), but the result of massive, recursive algorithmic processes ([[Crane]]s) running over deep time. To understand the mind, we must reverse-engineer the algorithms of the brain.
