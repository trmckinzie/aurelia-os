# ⚛️ Replicator

**🔗 Related:** 

---

### 💡 Definition
> Replicators are entities—most notably genes—that make copies of themselves with sufficient fidelity, longevity, and fecundity to persist through [[Evolution]]ary time.

### 📝 Key Insight
* Natural selection operates most fundamentally on replicators, not on organisms or groups, because replicators are what endure across generations.
- Organisms function as [[Survival Machines]] built by replicators to enhance their own replication, not as the primary targets of selection.
- Viewing [[Gene]] as replicators clarifies how complex adaptations and even cooperative behaviors can evolve without foresight or intention.
