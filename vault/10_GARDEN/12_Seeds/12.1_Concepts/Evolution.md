### 💡 Definition
> Evolution is the process by which heritable variation in populations changes over generations through mechanisms such as natural selection, mutation, genetic drift, and gene flow.

### 📝 Key Insight
- Evolution operates at the **population level**, not the level of individual organisms.
- Apparent design and complexity can emerge from **blind, cumulative processes** without foresight or purpose.
- Evolution is **context-dependent and constrained** by history; adaptations are shaped by prior conditions, not optimal redesign.
- Selection acts on **variation that already exists**; it cannot produce traits on demand, which explains tradeoffs, imperfections, and path dependence.
- Multiple mechanisms operate simultaneously—**selection, drift, mutation, and gene flow**—with their relative influence varying by population size and environment.
- Evolutionary explanations are **probabilistic, not deterministic**: they account for tendencies and distributions, not fixed outcomes for individuals.
