# ⚛️ Skyhook

**🔗 Related:**

---

### 💡 Definition
> Skyhooks are illegitimate explanatory shortcuts that account for complexity by appealing to unexplained intelligence, purpose, or magic rather than to step-by-step mechanisms.

### 📝 Key Insight
* Skyhooks give the illusion of explanation while actually blocking deeper understanding by stopping inquiry prematurely.
- They often appear in arguments about mind, consciousness, morality, or design when complexity feels “too impressive” to arise naturally.
- Replacing skyhooks with [[Crane]] is central to [[Daniel Dennett]]'s naturalistic method of explanation.
