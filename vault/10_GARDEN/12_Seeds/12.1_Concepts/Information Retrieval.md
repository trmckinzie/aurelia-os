**🔗 Related:** [[Memory]]

---

### 💡 Definition
> Information retrieval is the process of accessing stored representations to make them available for use in [[Cognition]], [[computation]], or decision-making.

### 📝 Key Insight
- Retrieval is **reconstructive**, shaped by context, cues, and prior knowledge.
- Efficient retrieval depends on **organization and [[indexing]]**, not storage alone.
- Failures of retrieval often reflect access problems, not information loss.
