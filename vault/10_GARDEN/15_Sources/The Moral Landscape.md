# 📖 The Moral Landscape

### 💡 The Core Argument (Thesis)
>The distinction between "facts" (science) and "values" (morality) is an illusion. Morality is strictly about the **well-being of conscious creatures**. Since "well-being" depends on the state of the human brain and the laws of physics/sociology, there are objective answers to moral questions, even if we do not possess them yet. Harris proposes a **Landscape of Morality**: a hypothetical space where "peaks" correspond to societies of maximal flourishing and "valleys" correspond to maximal suffering. Science can and should dictate which cultural practices lead to the peaks, effectively making moral relativism intellectually bankrupt.

### 🧠 Concepts Extracted
*(Concepts linked here will show in Graph View)*
- **[[The Moral Landscape]]:** The central metaphor. A space of all possible experiences, where navigation is a matter of truth, not opinion. There are many peaks (multiple valid ways to flourish), but far more valleys.
- **[[Scientific Realism]]:** The stance that moral truths exist independently of our ability to measure them (just as the number of stars in the galaxy is a fact, even if uncounted).
- **[[The Is-Ought Problem]]:** (Hume’s Guillotine). Harris attempts to bridge this by asserting a single axiom: "The worst possible misery for everyone is bad." Once accepted, "Ought" becomes a navigation problem of "Is."
- **[[Well-being]]:** The universal metric. Harris defines this biologically and psychologically, effectively naturalizing ethics.
- **[[Moral Relativism]]:** The opposing concept. Harris attacks the idea that we cannot judge other cultures (e.g., those that practice honor killings) as a failure of intellectual courage.
