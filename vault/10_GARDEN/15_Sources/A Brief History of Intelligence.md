### 💡 The Core Argument (Thesis)
>**Built for Movement, Not Truth:** The evolutionary purpose of a nervous system is **motricity** (movement). As evidenced by the _Sea Squirt_ (which digests its own brain once it finds a permanent rock to attach to), a brain is only necessary for an organism that must navigate a dynamic environment. Therefore, our cognitive faculties (memory, planning, reason) are not designed for abstract philosophy; they are "add-ons" to a motor control system designed to move the organism toward food and away from danger.

### 🧠 Concepts Extracted
*(Concepts linked here will show in Graph View)*
* **[[Steering]]** (The 1st Breakthrough): The Cambrian explosion of agency. The ability to distinguish "Self" from "World" and move towards positive valence (food) and away from negative valence (threats). (Correlates to early robotics/sensors).
- **[[Reinforcement Learning]]** (The 2nd Breakthrough): The evolution of the **Basal Ganglia**. The shift from hard-coded reflexes to learning from consequences (Trial and Error). This is the biological equivalent of the Temporal Difference Learning used in modern AI.
- **[[Simulation]]** (The 3rd Breakthrough): The rise of the **Neocortex** in mammals. The ability to pause action and run a "mental simulation" of the world to test a hypothesis without risking physical harm (Model-Based RL).
- **[[Mentalizing]]** (The 4th Breakthrough): The Primate shift to **Theory of Mind**. The recursive ability to simulate _other_ simulators ("I know that you know where the food is"). This is the foundation of complex social hierarchies and politics.
- **[[Language]]** (The 5th Breakthrough): The Human capacity for symbolic abstraction. This allowed for **Cumulative Culture**—we no longer need to learn everything from scratch; we can download the "software" of previous generations.
