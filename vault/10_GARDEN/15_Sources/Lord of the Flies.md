### 💡 The Core Argument (Thesis)
>A Nobel Prize-winning allegorical novel about a group of British schoolboys stranded on an uninhabited island after a plane crash. Initially, they attempt to establish a democratic society (mimicking the adults they left behind), but the social order quickly disintegrates under the weight of fear and the lust for power. The group fractures into two factions: the civilized, rule-following group led by **Ralph**, and the savage, hunting-obsessed tribe led by **Jack**.
>
>Written in the shadow of World War II and the Cold War, the book is a counter-narrative to R.M. Ballantyne’s _The Coral Island_ (a Victorian story where British boys spread civilization to savages). Golding argues the opposite: that "civilization" is a thin veneer, and without social constraints, even well-behaved children will revert to primal barbarism.

### 🔑 Key Themes (Classical View)

- **Civilization vs. Savagery:** The central conflict of the book. It posits that moral behavior is forced upon individuals by civilization (the police, the school, the law) rather than being an innate expression of human nature. When the structure is removed, the "darkness of man's heart" takes over.
- **The Nature of Evil (Original Sin):** Golding suggests that evil is not an external force (a ghost or a beast) but an internal defect of humanity. As the visionary character **Simon** realizes about the Beast: _"Maybe it's only us."_
- **The Loss of Innocence:** The boys transition from playing games to committing murder. The ending—where a naval officer rescues them and remarks that they should have put up a "better show"—highlights the irony: the adult world they are returning to is engaged in a nuclear war, which is just a larger, more organized version of the boys' savagery.
### 💎 Key Symbols

- **The Conch:** Represents law, order, and democratic legitimacy. When the shell is shattered, civilization ends.
- **Piggy’s Glasses:** Represent science, intellect, and the power to create (fire). Their theft marks the shift from reason to brute force.
- **The Signal Fire:** Represents the connection to civilization and the hope of rescue. When it is allowed to go out, it symbolizes the acceptance of savagery.
- **The Lord of the Flies:** The severed sow's head on a stick. A translation of _Beelzebub_ (a demon). It represents the physical manifestation of the beast, a totem of the primal impulse to destroy.

### 🧠 Character Archetypes (Freudian/Political)
- **Ralph:** The Ego / Democracy. He attempts to balance the conflicting needs of the group and focuses on long-term survival (the fire).
- **Jack:** The Id / Autocracy. He is driven by immediate gratification, violence, and the desire for dominance.
- **Piggy:** The Superego / Intellect. The voice of reason and social conditioning, but physically weak and ignored.
- **Simon:** The Soul / Prophet. The only character who possesses natural goodness and insight, making him the inevitable sacrificial victim.
