# 📚 Lit Review Overview

>This Notebook houses materials and resources for both the Business Strategy Game and the HBR On Strategy, 10 Articles of which TEAM Orange will present Chapters 1 & 10. 
# 📚 Chapter 1 : What is Strategy 

> Michael Porter’s "What Is Strategy?" argues that **strategy is the creation of a unique and valuable position** involving a different set of activities than those performed by rivals. It requires a company to deliberately choose to be different to establish a sustainable competitive advantage.

1. Operational Effectiveness (OE) vs. Strategy

The root of many companies' failure to realize sustainable profit is the inability to distinguish between **Operational Effectiveness** and **Strategy**.

• **Operational Effectiveness (OE):** This means performing similar activities **better** (faster, with fewer defects or lower costs) than rivals. While OE is necessary for superior performance, it is rarely sufficient because "best practices" diffuse quickly as competitors emulate one another.

• **The Productivity Frontier:** This represents the maximum value a company can deliver at a given cost using the best available technology and skills. As companies move toward this frontier, they experience **competitive convergence**, where they become indistinguishable, and profits are captured by customers and suppliers rather than the firm.

• **Strategic Positioning:** Unlike OE, strategy is about performing **different activities** from rivals or performing similar activities in **different ways**.

2. The Three Sources of Strategic Positioning

Strategic positions emerge from three distinct sources that are not mutually exclusive:

• **Variety-Based Positioning:** Based on producing a subset of an industry’s products or services rather than targeting a specific customer segment. This makes sense when a company can produce those items best using a **distinctive set of activities** (e.g., Jiffy Lube focusing only on auto lubricants).

• **Needs-Based Positioning:** Serving most or all the needs of a **particular group of customers**. This arises when a tailored set of activities can serve those specific needs best (e.g., Ikea targeting young furniture buyers who want style at a low cost).

• **Access-Based Positioning:** Segmenting customers who are **accessible in different ways** (e.g., geography or scale). Serving small-town customers vs. urban customers requires different configurations of marketing and logistics (e.g., Carmike Cinemas operating only in cities with populations under 200,000).

3. The Necessity of Trade-offs

A strategic position is only sustainable if there are **trade-offs with other positions**. Strategy is as much about choosing **what not to do** as it is about choosing what to do.

• **Why Trade-offs Arise:** They occur due to inconsistencies in image or reputation, from the activities themselves (which require different equipment or employee behaviors), or from limits on internal coordination and control.

• **Protection Against Imitation:** Trade-offs protect a company against **"straddlers"**—competitors who try to match the benefits of a successful position while maintaining their existing one. Continental Lite failed because it tried to be a low-cost carrier while still maintaining the activities of a full-service airline, leading to massive inefficiencies.

4. The Role of "Fit"

Strategy is about **combining activities into a system** rather than focusing on individual core competencies or critical resources. "Fit" creates a chain that is only as strong as its strongest link, making it difficult for rivals to imitate.

There are three types of fit:

• **First-order (Consistency):** Simple alignment between each activity and the overall strategy (e.g., Vanguard aligning all activities with a low-cost approach).

• **Second-order (Reinforcing):** Activities that strengthen one another (e.g., Neutrogena's marketing to upscale hotels reinforces its reputation among dermatologists).

• **Third-order (Optimization of Effort):** Coordination across activities to eliminate redundancy and minimize wasted effort (e.g., The Gap's daily restocking from warehouses to minimize in-store inventory).

5. Rediscovering Strategy

Porter notes that the greatest threat to strategy often comes from **within the company**, particularly the **desire to grow**. In the pursuit of incremental growth, managers often broaden their positions by adding features or imitating rivals, which blurs the company’s original uniqueness and erodes its competitive advantage.

To maintain a strategy, leadership must provide the **discipline to say no**, set limits, and focus on deepening a strategic position rather than compromising it in the name of "easy" growth

# 📚 Chapter 10 : What is Strategy 

>"Who Has the D?" explores how ambiguity in decision-making roles is a primary cause of organizational stalls and poor performance. The article introduces the **RAPID framework** to clarify accountability and ensure that the right people are involved in the right decisions at the right time.

1. The Decision-Making Bottlenecks

Ambiguity typically causes decisions to get "stuck" at four common organizational bottlenecks:

• **Global vs. Local:** Conflicts arise over how much authority local markets should have to tailor products versus maintaining global economies of scale.

• **Center vs. Business Unit:** Tensions exist between headquarters, which sees the "big picture," and business units on the front line.

• **Function vs. Function:** The most common bottleneck, often occurring between groups like marketing and product development, where neither is sure who has the final say.

• **Inside vs. Outside Partners:** With the rise of outsourcing and strategic alliances, companies must be clear on which decisions are delegated and which are kept internal.

2. The RAPID Decision Model

The RAPID model identifies five critical roles necessary for any effective decision-making process. Note that these roles are not necessarily performed in the order of the acronym.

|Role|Responsibility|
|---|---|
|**Recommend (R)**|**Propose a course of action.** They gather input and provide the data and analysis required to make a sensible choice in a timely manner.|
|**Agree (A)**|**Veto power.** These individuals must sign off on a recommendation. If they disagree, they must work with the "Recommender" to find an alternative or escalate it to the "Decider".|
|**Perform (P)**|**Implementation.** These people are responsible for executing the decision promptly and effectively once it is made.|
|**Input (I)**|**Fact-finding.** These individuals are consulted for facts regarding a proposal's feasibility. Their input is not binding, but "Recommenders" should take it seriously to ensure successful execution.|
|**Decide (D)**|**Final accountability.** This is the single person who brings the decision to closure and commits the organization to act. They must have strong business judgment.|

3. Core Principles of Decisive Organizations

The article outlines several hallmarks of high-performing organizations that have mastered their "Decision Metabolism":

• **Action is the Goal:** The objective of a decision-making process should be **buy-in, not consensus**, which can often become an obstacle to action.

• **Ambiguity is the Enemy:** Gridlock is the most likely outcome when it is unclear who contributes input, who makes the final call, and who carries it out.

• **Roles Over Org Charts:** Effective decision-making involves the right people regardless of their level in the formal hierarchy.

• **Only One "D":** If two or more people believe they are in charge of a single decision, it results in a destructive "tug-of-war".

• **Speed Matters:** A good decision executed quickly often beats a brilliant decision implemented slowly.

4. Avoiding Common Pitfalls

To maintain a high-functioning system, management should watch for these warning signs:

• **A Proliferation of "A's":** Too many people with veto power can paralyze the process. This often suggests that decisions are not being pushed far enough down into the organization.

• **Meaningless "I's":** If a vast number of people are providing input, it is likely that many of them are not making a meaningful contribution.

• **Second-Guessing:** Decisions should rarely be revisited once made. Frequent second-guessing suggests a lack of clarity in roles and a breakdown in organizational trust.

# 📚 Global Business Strategy : Quick Guide to Mastering the Game

>To win the Business Strategy Game (BSG), you must transcend basic operational understanding and adopt a perspective rooted in **long-term strategic coherence and rigorous financial engineering**. Success is the cumulative effect of hundreds of interconnected decisions across production, marketing, distribution, and finance.

1. Choosing and Maintaining a Strategy

You must choose a deliberate strategic path by the end of Year 11 and maintain consistency through Year 20. **Strategic "drifting"—switching between low-cost and differentiation—leads to mediocre performance** because the company fails to optimize its facilities and brand image for either path.

• **Low-Cost Provider:** Focus on achieving meaningfully lower costs than rivals through efficiency and scale, then underpricing competitors to capture market share.

• **Broad Differentiation:** Focus on unique product attributes (high S/Q ratings, many models, influential celebrities) that consumers find valuable and will pay a premium for.

• **Best-Cost Provider (Hybrid):** Provide high-quality shoes at a lower price than other premium brands, aiming for value-conscious buyers.

• **Focus Strategies:** Target a narrow market niche, such as a specific geographic region or a narrow product line.

2. Mastering Performance Metrics (KPIs)

The simulation evaluates your management team on five key indicators, typically weighted equally at 20%:

• **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** Boost this by **increasing net profit (numerator) and aggressively buying back stock (denominator)**.

• **Return on Equity (ROE):** Improve this by maintaining high net income while **reducing shareholders' equity through stock repurchases and dividends**.

• **Stock Price:** This is correlated to both EPS and ROE. Consistently beating investor expectations and increasing dividends year-over-year will drive the price up.

• **Credit Rating:** Calculated via the interest coverage ratio, debt-to-asset ratio, and risk of default. **Focus cash flow on reducing the debt-to-asset ratio** and refinancing high-interest debt to improve this score.

• **Image Rating:** Based on your S/Q rating, market share, and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) efforts. Aim for a rating above 70 to remain competitive.

3. Operational Excellence and Production

• **Regional Advantage:** Move quickly to expand manufacturing capacity in **Asia-Pacific and Latin America**, where labor costs are significantly lower than in North America or Europe.

• **Plant Upgrades:** Invest in upgrades that complement your strategy. **Upgrade B** is vital for high-model strategies as it reduces setup costs. **Upgrade C** is powerful for differentiators as it boosts S/Q ratings by 1 star at lower material costs. **Upgrade D** increases worker productivity by 25-50%, making it essential for low-cost leaders.

• **Workforce Training:** **Always max out Best Practices Training** ($3,500 per worker). This reduces reject rates, improves S/Q ratings, and increases worker productivity, often paying for itself within two years.

• **Capacity Utilization:** Use all available capacity every year for branded or private-label production to spread fixed costs (depreciation, administrative salaries) over more units.

4. Strategic Marketing and Distribution

• **Competitive Factors:** Monitor 11 to 13 factors, including price, S/Q rating, advertising, and delivery time. **Wholesale Price, S/Q rating, and product line breadth** are the three most critical factors for buyers.

• **Channel Conflict:** Ensure your **Internet Price is at least 40% above your Wholesale Price**. If online prices are too low, retailers will view you as a competitor and may refuse to stock your brand.

• **Celebrity Endorsements:** Avoid bidding too high ($20,000+), as the marginal revenue may not cover the cost. Focus on a "stable" of athletes that provide maximum appeal in regions where you have the most capacity.

• **Private Label:** View this as a "battlefield" to defeat competitors. Bidding low enough to win large contracts allows you to flood the market and prevent others from selling their shoes, while also maintaining high plant utilization.

5. Financial Engineering and Analysis

• **Stock Buybacks:** This is the most effective way to grow EPS and ROE. **Buy back the maximum amount of stock allowed every year** while the price is low, especially in the early rounds (Year 11-14). **Selling stock is often the single biggest mistake a team can make**.

• **Debt Management:** Use 10-year loans rather than 5-year loans for large expansions; 5-year loans require double the principal payment and can severely hurt your credit rating.

• **Reporting and Forecasting:** Spend 50% of your decision time analyzing the **Footwear Industry Report (FIR)** and **Competitive Intelligence Report (CIR)**. Use **forecasting spreadsheets** to anticipate rival moves and perform "worst-case scenario" trend analysis.

• **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):** Invest in Energy Efficiency, Ethics Training, and Workforce Diversity. These initiatives provide a steady boost to image rating and worker productivity for a minimal impact on net profit.

# 📚 Global Business Strategy : BSG Strategy Architecture 

>Success in the Business Strategy Game requires management teams to transcend basic operational decisions and adopt a long-term perspective rooted in **strategic coherence and rigorous financial engineering**. Management must choose a deliberate strategic path by the end of Year 11 and maintain consistency through Year 20, as **strategic "drifting"—switching between different approaches—leads to mediocre performance** and fails to optimize production facilities or brand image. The sources outline several frameworks for these competitive strategy options, ranging from generic theoretical models to specific quadrant-based applications.

Specific BSG Strategic Guide Options

The BSG Strategic Guide categorizes competitive options into four primary strategies based on the relationship between **Star Quality (S/Q) ratings and product line breadth (models)**:

• **Low Quality, Low Models, and Low Price:** This is the easiest strategy to execute and uses **price penetration** to impact the industry, but it often does not fare well in the long term against more advanced competitors.

• **High Quality, Low Models, and Lower Medium Price:** This approach is relatively easy to perform and is viable for the long term because the **high quality allows for significant image rating points**.

• **Low Quality, High Models, and Higher Medium Price:** This is a more difficult strategy that offers flexibility and **high profit potential** by taking advantage of cost-saving plant upgrades B and C.

• **High Quality, High Models, and High Price:** This is the **most complicated but potentially most profitable** strategy; it requires achieving economies of scale and is typically only effective in the late game.

Five Generic Competitive Strategies

Drawing on Michael Porter’s framework, the simulation also presents five generic options distinguished by their **market target (broad vs. narrow)** and the **type of competitive advantage (lower cost vs. differentiation)**:

• **Low-Cost Provider:** Aims for a competitive advantage by achieving **meaningfully lower costs than rivals**, allowing the firm to either underprice competitors or reap higher margins at standard prices.

• **Broad Differentiation:** Focuses on creating **unique product attributes** that a wide range of buyers find valuable enough to pay a premium for.

• **Focused Low-Cost:** Targets a **narrow market niche** or specific geographic region by serving members at a lower cost than rivals.

• **Focused Differentiation:** Seeks to compete in a narrow niche with a product carefully designed to appeal to the **unique preferences** of that specific group.

• **Best-Cost Provider (Hybrid):** Strives to deliver **superior value** by meeting buyer expectations on quality and features while beating their price expectations.

Strategic Context and Execution

The simulation is designed with **no built-in bias** favoring any single strategy; most well-executed approaches can succeed provided they are not thwarted by rivals. Key insights for execution include:

• **Price is a Reflection, Not just a Slogan:** Having the lowest price is only an effective strategy if it reflects **greater efficiency and lower costs**, similar to the Walmart model.

• **Niche Positioning:** The only major decision remaining for companies dominating all geographic regions is deciding which **niche of quality and models** to occupy.

• **Resource-Based Success:** Strategies must be underpinned by appropriate resources; for instance, a low-cost leader must have the **resource strengths to keep costs below competitors** through scale and efficiency.

• **Analysis of the "White Space":** Elite teams use strategic group maps to find underserved market segments—**"white space"**—where they can capture demand without intense competition
