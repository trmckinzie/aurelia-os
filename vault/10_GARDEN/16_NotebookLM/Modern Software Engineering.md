# 📚 Lit Review Overview
> These sources collectively explore the **evolution of software engineering** and the transformative impact of **artificial intelligence** on modern development practices. They define core industry terminology, distinguishing **coding** as the act of writing instructions from **software engineering** as a holistic lifecycle involving design, maintenance, and project management. A significant portion of the material provides practical guidance for **beginners**, suggesting that **AI assistants** like ChatGPT and Copilot be used as interactive mentors rather than simple shortcuts. The documentation also details technical workflows for building **mobile apps**, managing **databases with Firebase**, and deploying projects via **GitHub and Netlify**. Ultimately, the texts emphasize that while **Large Language Models** can accelerate tasks like debugging and refactoring, maintaining **human oversight** and a strong grasp of fundamentals is essential for long-term mastery.
