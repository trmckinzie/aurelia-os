# 📚 Lit Review Overview

> CH 1:  (OSC) Management

> **Operations and supply chain management (OSCM)** is defined as the design, operation, and improvement of the systems that create and deliver a firm’s primary products and services. It is a functional field of business involving clear line management responsibilities and the oversight of the entire production and delivery system.

Success in OSCM depends on the clever integration of a great **strategy**, efficient **processes** to deliver products, and **analytics** to support management decisions.

Core Supply Chain Processes

The activities within a supply chain are generally categorized into five specific process steps:

• **Planning:** Developing the processes needed to operate an existing supply chain.

• **Sourcing:** Selecting the suppliers that will deliver the goods and services required to create the firm’s product.

• **Making:** The major manufacturing or service process where the product is produced or the service is provided.

• **Delivering:** Logistics processes, including selecting carriers, coordinating the movement of goods and information, and collecting payments.

• **Returning:** Receiving worn-out, excess, or defective products back from customers and providing customer support.

The Goods–Services Continuum

The sources describe a spectrum between "Pure Goods" and "Pure Services".

• **Pure Goods:** Includes food products, chemicals, and mining.

• **Core Goods:** Includes appliances and automobiles.

• **Core Services:** Includes hotels, airlines, and internet service providers.

• **Pure Services:** Includes education (universities), medical care, and investment services.

• **Service Business Categories:** Services are further categorized by what they impact, such as human bodies (fitness centers), physical products (freight), people's minds (education), or risk/money management (banking).

Efficiency, Effectiveness, and Value

A critical part of OSCM is evaluating how well a firm performs.

• **Efficiency:** Doing something at the **lowest possible cost**. **Southwest Airlines** is cited as a leader in efficiency due to its fast plane turnaround times (30 to 55 minutes), which allows for more flights and revenue per day.

• **Effectiveness:** Doing the right things to create the **most value** for the company.

• **Value:** Abstractly defined as **Quality divided by Price**.

To evaluate efficiency, Wall Street often looks at **Management Efficiency Ratios**, such as **Receivable Turnover** (Annual Credit Sales / Average Account Receivable), **Inventory Turnover** (COGS / Average Inventory Value), and **Asset Turnover** (Revenue / Total Assets).

Careers and the COO Role

Careers in OSCM are "hands-on" and involve figuring out the best ways to plan, produce, and distribute goods.

• **Specialist Areas:** Include product design, purchasing, manufacturing, service operations, logistics, and distribution.

• **The Chief Operating Officer (COO):** Works with the CEO to determine the company’s competitive strategy. The COO makes high-level decisions regarding **location, facilities, and vendors**, which are then carried out by lower-level personnel.

Historical Concepts and Current Issues

OSCM has evolved through several major concepts, starting from the Industrial Revolution to modern trends like **Sustainability** (the "Triple Bottom Line" of social, economic, and environmental criteria), **Business Analytics**, and the **Internet of Things**.

Today, the field faces several challenges:

1. Uncertainty in **global tariffs** and regulations.

2. Difficulty in **hiring and retaining** employees.

3. Adapting to rapid changes in **business technology** and infrastructure

>CH 2: (OSC) Strategy

>**Operations and supply chain (OSC) strategy** involves setting broad policies and plans for using a firm's resources to implement its corporate strategy. It coordinates operational goals with the larger organization's direction to ensure **operations effectiveness**, which means performing activities at a minimum cost while meeting strategic priorities.

Strategy Formulation and Implementation

The process of formulating an OSC strategy moves from **strategic analysis** (defining vision and competitive priorities) to **initiatives** (product design and supply chain changes), and finally to **implementation projects**.

To implement these strategies effectively, all operations activities must relate to one another. For example, **IKEA** implements its strategy by targeting low-cost buyers through a self-service model, modular furniture design, and in-store child care, ensuring all activities minimize total cost while meeting customer needs.

Competitive Dimensions and Market Positioning

Firms compete across several dimensions, and management must decide which are critical to their success.

• **Key Competitive Dimensions:** These include price (making it cheap), quality (making it great), delivery speed, delivery reliability, and flexibility in volume or new-product introduction.

• **Support Criteria:** Technical support, meeting launch dates, after-sale support, and environmental impact also serve as competitive factors.

• **Trade-offs and Straddling:** Because a firm often cannot excel at every dimension simultaneously, it must make trade-offs. **Straddling** occurs when a firm tries to match a competitor's features while keeping its existing position, which is often a risky strategy.

• **Order Winners vs. Qualifiers:** **Order qualifiers** are the minimum features required for a customer to even consider a product, while **order winners** are the specific criteria that differentiate a product enough for a customer to ultimately buy it.

Assessing and Mitigating Supply Chain Risk

Strategies inherently carry risk, specifically the likelihood of disruptions that impact a company's ability to supply products or services. These are categorized as **coordination risks** (day-to-day management) or **disruption risks** (natural or manmade disasters).

**Risk Mitigation Framework:**

1. **Identify** potential sources of significant disruption.

2. **Assess** the potential impact (financial, reputational, or human) and probability of the risk.

3. **Develop plans** to mitigate the risk.

|Risk Type|Mitigation Strategy Examples|
|---|---|
|**Natural Disaster**|Contingency planning, alternate sites, and insurance.|
|**Supplier Failure**|Use of multiple suppliers.|
|**Logistics Failure**|Safety stock and detailed tracking.|
|**Regulatory Risk**|Legal advice and compliance research.|

Productivity Measurement

Productivity is a relative measure of how well a firm uses its resources, calculated as the ratio of **outputs to inputs**. To be meaningful, it must be compared to other operations, other firms, or the same firm over time.

• **Partial Productivity:** Compares output to a single input (e.g., sales per square foot).

• **Multifactor Productivity:** Compares output to a group of inputs (e.g., output divided by labor + capital + energy).

• **Total Productivity:** Compares output to all inputs used.

Sustainable Business Strategy

A sustainable strategy meets the goals of **shareholders** (legal owners) and **stakeholders** (those influenced by the firm) without compromising the needs of future generations. This is often measured using the **Triple Bottom Line**, which evaluates a firm against three criteria:

• **Social Responsibility:** Fair and beneficial business practices toward labor and the community.

• **Economic Prosperity:** The obligation to compensate shareholders with a return on capital.

• **Environmental Stewardship:** Minimizing the firm's impact on the environment.

>CH 3: Design of Products and Services

>Building on our previous discussions regarding operations strategy and management, **Chapter 3** focuses on the **Design of Products and Services**. This process is integral to a firm's long-term success, as companies must continuously bring new products to market to remain competitive.

Core Concepts in Product Design

Before starting the design process, firms must identify their **core competency**—the one thing they do better than competitors that is difficult to imitate and provides access to various markets.

Many companies now use **contract manufacturers**, which are organizations that perform manufacturing or purchasing as a service for another firm rather than for themselves. For example, **Apple** designs the iPhone but subcontracts the fabrication while retaining the intellectual property (IP).

The Generic Product Development Process

A formal product development process typically follows six distinct phases:

1. **Phase 0: Planning:** Begins with corporate strategy and results in a project mission statement.

2. **Phase 1: Concept Development:** Identifies the needs of the target market and selects one or more product concepts for further testing.

3. **Phase 2: System-Level Design:** Defines the product architecture, breaking it down into subsystems and components.

4. **Phase 3: Design Detail:** Provides complete specifications for geometry, materials, and tolerances for all parts.

5. **Phase 4: Testing and Refinement:** Involves building and evaluating multiple preproduction prototypes.

6. **Phase 5: Production Ramp-Up:** Workers are trained, and remaining problems are resolved as production gradually transitions to full scale.

Variants of the Design Process

Not all products follow the generic "market-pull" model. Different product types require different approaches:

|Process Type|Description|Examples|
|---|---|---|
|**Technology-Push**|Starts with a new technology and looks for a market.|Gore-Tex rainwear.|
|**Platform Products**|Built around an established technological subsystem.|Consumer electronics, printers.|
|**Process-Intensive**|The production process impacts product properties; design cannot be separated.|Snack foods, semiconductors.|
|**Quick-Build**|Rapid modeling allows for many design-build-test cycles.|Software, cellular phones.|

Tools for Effective Design

Firms use specific methodologies to ensure designs meet customer and business needs:

• **Quality Function Deployment (QFD):** Uses interfunctional teams to translate customer requirements into clear objectives and specifications. The primary tool for this is the **House of Quality** matrix.

• **Value Analysis/Value Engineering (VA/VE):** Brainstorming to simplify products and processes to achieve better performance at a lower cost.

• **Concurrent Engineering:** A collaborative approach where designers and builders work together simultaneously, replacing the traditional "over-the-wall" method.

• **Ecodesign:** Incorporating environmental considerations throughout the entire product life cycle.

Designing Service Products

Service design differs because **direct customer involvement** introduces variability. Two key dimensions are used to analyze service processes:

• **Complexity:** The number of steps involved in a service.

• **Divergence:** The number of ways a customer/provider interaction can vary at each step.

Economic Analysis and Performance

To justify a project, firms use **economic analysis**, building a base-case financial model to calculate the **Net Present Value (NPV)**. They also perform **sensitivity analysis** to answer "what-if" questions regarding changes in sales volume, price, or development costs.

Success is measured using three criteria:

• **Time to Market:** Frequency of new introductions and time from concept to market.

• **Productivity:** The cost of materials, tooling, and engineering hours used.

• **Quality:** Reliability, performance features, and the ability of the process to produce the product.

>CH 4: Project Management

>**Chapter 4** focuses on **Project Management**, which involves planning, directing, and controlling resources—such as people, equipment, and material—to meet the technical, cost, and time constraints of a project. A **project** is defined as a series of related jobs directed toward a major output that requires a significant period of time to perform.

Project Organization and Structure

Projects are categorized into four types: **product change, process change, research and development, and alliance and partnerships**. Organizations typically choose one of three structures to manage these projects:

|Structure|Description|Key Advantage|Key Disadvantage|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Pure Project**|A self-contained team works full-time on the project.|High commitment and one boss.|Duplication of resources.|
|**Functional Project**|The project is housed within one functional area (e.g., Engineering).|Technical expertise stays in the "home" area.|Weak motivation; client needs are secondary.|
|**Matrix Project**|A blend where people from different functional areas work together.|Better communication between areas.|Two bosses; relies on PM's negotiation skills.|

Organizing and Planning Tasks

To manage a project effectively, tasks must be clearly defined and organized.

• **Statement of Work (SOW):** A written description of the objectives.

• **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** A hierarchy that defines the project tasks, subtasks, and work packages.

• **Work Package:** A group of activities that can be assigned to a single organizational unit.

• **Project Milestones:** Specific events that mark important progress.

• **Gantt Chart:** A visual bar chart showing the amount of time and the sequence of activities.

Earned Value Management (EVM)

**Earned Value Management** is a technique for measuring project progress objectively by combining scope, schedule, and cost. It allows managers to see if a project is truly on track beyond just looking at the budget spent.

• **BCWS (Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled):** The value of the work planned to be done by a specific time.

• **BCWP (Budgeted Cost of Work Performed):** Also known as **Earned Value**, this is the actual value of work completed.

• **AC (Actual Cost):** The actual cost of the work performed.

• **Performance Measures:** Managers use the **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)** and **Cost Performance Index (CPI)** to determine if the project is ahead/behind schedule or under/over budget.

Network-Planning Models

The **Critical Path Method (CPM)** is the most widely used approach for project scheduling.

• **Critical Path:** The sequence of activities that forms the **longest chain** in a project; any delay in these tasks will delay the entire project.

• **Slack:** The difference between the late and early start times for an activity; activities on the critical path have zero slack.

• **PERT Method:** Used when task times are probabilistic rather than fixed. It requires three time estimates: **optimistic (a), most likely (m), and pessimistic (b)** to calculate expected completion time and probability.

Project Crashing (Time-Cost Trade-offs)

**Crashing** is the procedure used to reduce the total project duration by trading off time for cost.

• **Direct Costs:** Costs associated with expediting activities (e.g., overtime, extra labor).

• **Indirect Costs:** Costs associated with sustaining the project over time (e.g., overhead).

• The goal is to find the **minimum-cost schedule** by shortening the critical path where costs are lowest.

Management Software

Project management concepts are implemented through commercial software like **Microsoft Project** (popular for mid-sized projects) and **Primavera Project Planner** (preferred for very large programs). These tools help with scheduling, assigning resources, and "leveling" over-allocated resources.

>CH 5: Strategic Capacity Management and Operational Planning

>**Strategic capacity management** is the process of determining the overall level of capacity-intensive resources—including facilities, equipment, and labor—that best supports a company's long-range competitive strategy. Capacity itself is defined as the amount of output a system is capable of achieving over a specific period of time.

Core Capacity Concepts

To manage capacity effectively, firms must understand how their output levels affect costs and flexibility.

• **Capacity Utilization Rate:** This measure indicates how close a firm is to its **best operating level**, calculated by dividing the capacity used by the best possible operating level.

• **Economies of Scale:** As a plant gets larger and production volume increases, the **average cost per unit drops**.

• **Diseconomies of Scale:** This occurs when a plant becomes too large and the average cost per unit begins to increase.

• **Capacity Focus:** The "focused factory" or **plant within a plant (PWP)** concept suggests that production facilities work best when they concentrate on a limited set of objectives.

• **Capacity Flexibility:** This is the ability to rapidly increase or decrease production or shift between products. It is achieved through **flexible plants** (zero-changeover time), **flexible processes** (cross-training), and **flexible workers**.

Planning and Changing Capacity

Planning involves a timeline ranging from **long range** (greater than one year) to **intermediate** (6 to 18 months) and **short range** (less than one month). When changing capacity, firms must consider the following:

• **System Balance:** Managers aim for similar capacities at each operation and must specifically manage **bottleneck operations**.

• **Expansion Frequency:** Firms must weigh the costs of upgrading too frequently (small chunks) versus too infrequently (large chunks).

• **External Sources:** Capacity can be augmented through **outsourcing** or sharing capacity with other organizations.

• **Determining Requirements:** The process involves forecasting sales, calculating labor and equipment needs, and projecting resource availability over the planning horizon.

Decision Trees for Capacity Analysis

A **decision tree** is a schematic model used to evaluate capacity alternatives by organizing sequences of decisions and their consequences.

• **Components:** It uses **decision nodes** (squares), **chance nodes** (circles), and paths (links).

• **Methodology:** Analysts work from the end of the tree backward to the start, calculating expected values at each step to identify the best solution.

Manufacturing vs. Service Capacity

There are fundamental differences in how capacity is managed across these two sectors:

|Feature|Manufacturing Capacity|Service Capacity|
|---|---|---|
|**Storage**|Goods can be stored for later use.|Capacity **cannot be stored**; it must be available when needed.|
|**Location**|Goods can be shipped to other locations.|Service must be available at the **customer demand point**.|
|**Volatility**|Demand volatility is relatively low.|Demand volatility is typically much higher.|
|**Utilization**|Can aim for very high utilization.|Best operating point is near **70%** to maintain quality.|

In services, the relationship between **arrival rate** (customer entries) and **service rate** (processing speed) is critical. Low utilization rates are appropriate for high-uncertainty or high-stakes environments like emergency rooms, while higher rates are possible for predictable services like commuter trains.
