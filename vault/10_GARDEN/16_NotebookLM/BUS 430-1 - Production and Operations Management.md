# 📚 Lit Review Overview
> CHAPTER 1 Summary 
> 
> **Operations and supply chain management (OSCM)** is defined as the design, operation, and improvement of the systems that create and deliver a firm’s primary products and services. It is a functional field of business involving clear line management responsibilities and the oversight of the entire production and delivery system.

Success in OSCM depends on the clever integration of a great **strategy**, efficient **processes** to deliver products, and **analytics** to support management decisions.

Core Supply Chain Processes

The activities within a supply chain are generally categorized into five specific process steps:

• **Planning:** Developing the processes needed to operate an existing supply chain.

• **Sourcing:** Selecting the suppliers that will deliver the goods and services required to create the firm’s product.

• **Making:** The major manufacturing or service process where the product is produced or the service is provided.

• **Delivering:** Logistics processes, including selecting carriers, coordinating the movement of goods and information, and collecting payments.

• **Returning:** Receiving worn-out, excess, or defective products back from customers and providing customer support.

The Goods–Services Continuum

The sources describe a spectrum between "Pure Goods" and "Pure Services".

• **Pure Goods:** Includes food products, chemicals, and mining.

• **Core Goods:** Includes appliances and automobiles.

• **Core Services:** Includes hotels, airlines, and internet service providers.

• **Pure Services:** Includes education (universities), medical care, and investment services.

• **Service Business Categories:** Services are further categorized by what they impact, such as human bodies (fitness centers), physical products (freight), people's minds (education), or risk/money management (banking).

Efficiency, Effectiveness, and Value

A critical part of OSCM is evaluating how well a firm performs.

• **Efficiency:** Doing something at the **lowest possible cost**. **Southwest Airlines** is cited as a leader in efficiency due to its fast plane turnaround times (30 to 55 minutes), which allows for more flights and revenue per day.

• **Effectiveness:** Doing the right things to create the **most value** for the company.

• **Value:** Abstractly defined as **Quality divided by Price**.

To evaluate efficiency, Wall Street often looks at **Management Efficiency Ratios**, such as **Receivable Turnover** (Annual Credit Sales / Average Account Receivable), **Inventory Turnover** (COGS / Average Inventory Value), and **Asset Turnover** (Revenue / Total Assets).

Careers and the COO Role

Careers in OSCM are "hands-on" and involve figuring out the best ways to plan, produce, and distribute goods.

• **Specialist Areas:** Include product design, purchasing, manufacturing, service operations, logistics, and distribution.

• **The Chief Operating Officer (COO):** Works with the CEO to determine the company’s competitive strategy. The COO makes high-level decisions regarding **location, facilities, and vendors**, which are then carried out by lower-level personnel.

Historical Concepts and Current Issues

OSCM has evolved through several major concepts, starting from the Industrial Revolution to modern trends like **Sustainability** (the "Triple Bottom Line" of social, economic, and environmental criteria), **Business Analytics**, and the **Internet of Things**.

Today, the field faces several challenges:

1. Uncertainty in **global tariffs** and regulations.

2. Difficulty in **hiring and retaining** employees.

3. Adapting to rapid changes in **business technology** and infrastructure

>CHAPTER 2 Summary 

>**Operations and supply chain (OSC) strategy** involves setting broad policies and plans for using a firm's resources to implement its corporate strategy. It coordinates operational goals with the larger organization's direction to ensure **operations effectiveness**, which means performing activities at a minimum cost while meeting strategic priorities.

Strategy Formulation and Implementation

The process of formulating an OSC strategy moves from **strategic analysis** (defining vision and competitive priorities) to **initiatives** (product design and supply chain changes), and finally to **implementation projects**.

To implement these strategies effectively, all operations activities must relate to one another. For example, **IKEA** implements its strategy by targeting low-cost buyers through a self-service model, modular furniture design, and in-store child care, ensuring all activities minimize total cost while meeting customer needs.

Competitive Dimensions and Market Positioning

Firms compete across several dimensions, and management must decide which are critical to their success.

• **Key Competitive Dimensions:** These include price (making it cheap), quality (making it great), delivery speed, delivery reliability, and flexibility in volume or new-product introduction.

• **Support Criteria:** Technical support, meeting launch dates, after-sale support, and environmental impact also serve as competitive factors.

• **Trade-offs and Straddling:** Because a firm often cannot excel at every dimension simultaneously, it must make trade-offs. **Straddling** occurs when a firm tries to match a competitor's features while keeping its existing position, which is often a risky strategy.

• **Order Winners vs. Qualifiers:** **Order qualifiers** are the minimum features required for a customer to even consider a product, while **order winners** are the specific criteria that differentiate a product enough for a customer to ultimately buy it.

Assessing and Mitigating Supply Chain Risk

Strategies inherently carry risk, specifically the likelihood of disruptions that impact a company's ability to supply products or services. These are categorized as **coordination risks** (day-to-day management) or **disruption risks** (natural or manmade disasters).

**Risk Mitigation Framework:**

1. **Identify** potential sources of significant disruption.

2. **Assess** the potential impact (financial, reputational, or human) and probability of the risk.

3. **Develop plans** to mitigate the risk.

|Risk Type|Mitigation Strategy Examples|
|---|---|
|**Natural Disaster**|Contingency planning, alternate sites, and insurance.|
|**Supplier Failure**|Use of multiple suppliers.|
|**Logistics Failure**|Safety stock and detailed tracking.|
|**Regulatory Risk**|Legal advice and compliance research.|

Productivity Measurement

Productivity is a relative measure of how well a firm uses its resources, calculated as the ratio of **outputs to inputs**. To be meaningful, it must be compared to other operations, other firms, or the same firm over time.

• **Partial Productivity:** Compares output to a single input (e.g., sales per square foot).

• **Multifactor Productivity:** Compares output to a group of inputs (e.g., output divided by labor + capital + energy).

• **Total Productivity:** Compares output to all inputs used.

Sustainable Business Strategy

A sustainable strategy meets the goals of **shareholders** (legal owners) and **stakeholders** (those influenced by the firm) without compromising the needs of future generations. This is often measured using the **Triple Bottom Line**, which evaluates a firm against three criteria:

• **Social Responsibility:** Fair and beneficial business practices toward labor and the community.

• **Economic Prosperity:** The obligation to compensate shareholders with a return on capital.

• **Environmental Stewardship:** Minimizing the firm's impact on the environment.
