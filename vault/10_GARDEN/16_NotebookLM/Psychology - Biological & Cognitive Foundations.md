# 📚 Lit Review Overview
> Biological Foundations Manual: An Integrated Study of Brain, Behavior, and Perceptual Systems

>This manual serves as a comprehensive study guide for **Adams State University's PSYC 245: Brain and Behavior** and **PSYC 458: Sensation and Perception**. It integrates the biological substrate of the nervous system with the subjective psychological experience of reality

I. Neuroanatomy and Physiology (PSYC 245)

1. The Structure and Function of the Neuron

The **neuron** is the fundamental unit of the nervous system, specialized for electrochemical transmission. Its primary components include:

• **Soma (Cell Body):** The metabolic core containing the nucleus and genetic information, responsible for protein synthesis.

• **Dendrites:** Tree-like protrusions that serve as the primary receiving part of the neuron, collecting synaptic inputs from other axons.

• **Axon:** A single elongated fiber that conducts electrical signals (nerve impulses) away from the cell body toward target cells.

• **Myelin Sheath:** A fatty insulating layer formed by glial cells that accelerates the speed of signal transmission and prevents electrical interference.

• **Axon Terminals:** The distal ends where electrical signals are converted into chemical messages through the release of neurotransmitters into the **synaptic cleft**.

2. Neural Communication: Action Potentials and Synapses

Neurons communicate via **action potentials** (electrical "spikes") and chemical neurotransmitters.

• **The Action Potential:** This is an **all-or-none event**. A neuron maintains a resting membrane potential of approximately **-70 mV**. When the sum of excitatory and inhibitory inputs reaches a threshold (typically **-50 mV**), voltage-gated sodium channels open, causing a rapid influx of Na+ that depolarizes the cell to about +40 mV.

• **Synaptic Transmission:** When the action potential reaches the terminal, it triggers an influx of calcium (Ca2+), causing synaptic vesicles to fuse with the membrane and release neurotransmitters into the synapse. These chemicals diffuse across the gap (less than 40-50 nm wide) and bind to specific receptors on the postsynaptic neuron.

• **Neurotransmitters:**

    ◦ **Dopamine:** Involved in the brain's reward system, motivation, and motor control; dysfunctions are linked to Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.

    ◦ **Serotonin:** An inhibitory neurotransmitter produced in the raphe nuclei that regulates mood, sleep, appetite, and social behavior.

3. Major Brain Structures and Systems

The nervous system is divided into the **Central Nervous System (CNS)**, consisting of the brain and spinal cord, and the **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**, which relays information between the CNS and the rest of the body.

• **The Four Lobes of the Cerebral Cortex:**

    ◦ **Frontal Lobe:** Responsible for voluntary motor function, planning, reasoning, and personality; it contains the **Broca area** for language production.

    ◦ **Parietal Lobe:** Processes somatosensory information (touch, pain) and spatial orientation; it contains the somatosensory cortex.

    ◦ **Temporal Lobe:** Involved in auditory processing, memory storage, and language comprehension; it houses the **Wernicke area**.

    ◦ **Occipital Lobe:** The primary visual processing center.

• **The Limbic System:** A complex of structures managing emotion, memory, and survival.

    ◦ **Amygdala:** Regulates emotion, particularly fear, and processed the reward value of stimuli.

    ◦ **Hippocampus:** Critical for learning, converting short-term memories into long-term storage, and spatial navigation.

    ◦ **Hypothalamus:** Maintains homeostasis by regulating heart rate, appetite, thirst, and temperature.

II. Sensory Systems and Transduction (PSYC 458)

**Sensory transduction** is the process by which environmental stimuli are changed into the electrochemical signals of the nervous system.

1. Major Sensory Transduction Mechanisms

• **Vision:** Light strikes the retina, where photons are absorbed by **photoreceptors** (rods and cones). Unlike most receptors, light causes photoreceptors to **hyperpolarize**. This signal is processed by bipolar and ganglion cells before being sent to the brain via the optic nerve.

• **Audition:** Sound waves vibrate the tympanic membrane and ossicles, eventually moving fluid in the **cochlea**. This motion causes the **stereocilia** on hair cells to bend. Bending opens mechanically-gated ion channels, allowing potassium influx and depolarization, which triggers the release of glutamate onto the auditory nerve.

• **Somatosensation (Touch):** This general sense utilizes various **mechanoreceptors** in the skin. Mechanical pressure physically deforms the receptor membrane, pulling open ion channels to create a receptor potential. Examples include **Meissner’s corpuscles** (light touch) and **Pacinian corpuscles** (deep pressure/vibration).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

III. Perceptual Processing and Psychophysics

1. Bottom-Up vs. Top-Down Processing

• **Bottom-Up Processing:** A **data-driven** approach that begins with raw sensory input and builds toward higher-level perception without prior knowledge or expectations.

• **Top-Down Processing:** A **conceptually-driven** process where prior knowledge, experiences, and expectations guide the interpretation of sensory information. It allows the brain to "fill in the gaps" in ambiguous situations.

2. Psychophysics Concepts

Psychophysics quantifies the relationship between physical stimulus intensity and subjective sensation.

• **Absolute Threshold:** The minimum intensity of a stimulus that can be detected 50% of the time.

• **Just Noticeable Difference (JND):** Also known as the difference threshold, this is the smallest change in a stimulus that can be detected 50% of the time.

• **Weber’s Law:** States that the JND is not a fixed amount but a constant proportion of the original stimulus intensity.

• **Stevens’ Power Law:** A refined model suggesting perceived intensity (P) is related to physical intensity (I) raised to an exponent (n) (P=kIn). This explains **response compression** for light (n<1) and **response expansion** for pain (n>1).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IV. The Mind-Body Connection: Lesions and Deficits

The functional specialization of brain regions is often revealed through **lesions**—damage caused by stroke or trauma that leads to specific behavioral deficits.

1. Aphasia: Disruption of Language

• **Broca’s Aphasia (Non-fluent):** Results from damage to the frontal lobe. Patients struggle to produce speech, often speaking in short, effortful phrases, yet their comprehension remains relatively intact.

• **Wernicke’s Aphasia (Fluent):** Results from temporal lobe damage. Patients speak fluently with normal rhythm, but their speech is nonsensical ("word salad") and they have severe difficulty understanding language.

2. Agnosia: Failure of Recognition

**Agnosia** is the inability to recognize objects or sounds despite healthy sensory organs.

• **Apperceptive Agnosia:** A failure in recognition due to deficits in early perceptual processing; patients cannot draw or copy objects.

• **Associative Agnosia:** A failure in recognition despite normal perception; patients can draw objects but cannot assign meaning to them by sight alone.

• **Prosopagnosia (Face Blindness):** A specific inability to recognize familiar faces, often resulting from damage to the **fusiform face area** in the inferior temporal lobe.

• **Akinetopsia:** The inability to perceive motion, often due to damage in the dorsal "where" pathway of the parietal lobe.
