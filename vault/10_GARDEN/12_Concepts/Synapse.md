### 💡 Definition
> The specialized junction between two neurons where information is transmitted from one to the other. It is the fundamental unit of communication in the nervous system. Most synapses are **Chemical** (using molecules to bridge the gap), though some are **Electrical** (direct connections called gap junctions).

**The Architecture of Transmission:**

1. **The Pre-Synaptic Terminal (The Sender):** This is the end of the axon of the _first_ neuron. It contains **Synaptic Vesicles**—tiny balloons filled with neurotransmitters (chemical messages). When the electrical signal arrives here, it triggers the release of these chemicals.
    
2. **The Synaptic Cleft (The Gap):** The microscopic space (20-40 nm wide) between the two cells. The chemicals float across this moat.
    
3. **The Post-Synaptic Density (The Receiver):** This is the surface of the dendrite of the _second_ neuron. It is covered in **Receptors** (specialized locks) waiting for the neurotransmitters (keys). When the keys bind, they open channels to let ions in, starting a new electrical ripple.

### 📝 Key Insight
* - **The Digital-to-Analog Converter:** The synapse is where the brain converts signals from "Digital" to "Analog" and back again.
    
    - **Pre-Synaptic (Digital):** The incoming Action Potential is binary (All-or-Nothing). It either happens, or it doesn't.
        
    - **Synaptic Cleft (Analog):** The release of chemicals is graded. You can release a _little_ dopamine or a _lot_. This allows for modulation.
        
    - **Post-Synaptic (Integration):** The receiver sums up all these analog chemical inputs. If the sum hits a specific threshold, it triggers a new digital Action Potential.
        
- **Plasticity (The Physicality of Memory):** The "Strength" of a synapse is not fixed. Through processes like **Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)**, the pre-synaptic side can learn to release more chemicals, or the post-synaptic side can grow more receptors. This physical strengthening of the bridge is what we call "Learning."
