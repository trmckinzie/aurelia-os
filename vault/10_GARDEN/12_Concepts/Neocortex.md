### 💡 Definition
> The neocortex (neo=new) is a brain structure responsible for higher order functions such as sensory perception, thinking, and language. Human beings have a particularly well developed neocortex which explains our increased capacity for complex behaviors such as language, problem solving, reasoning, and abstraction. 

>The "new bark." It is the outermost layer of the brain (part of the cerebral cortex), unique to mammals, and most highly developed in humans. Morphologically, it is a thin, folded sheet of neural tissue (about the size of a dinner napkin if flattened out) roughly 2-4mm thick. It is responsible for higher-order brain functions such as sensory perception, cognition, generation of motor commands, spatial reasoning, and language. Structurally, it is uniform—composed of repeating units called **Cortical Columns**—suggesting a single, universal algorithm for processing information.

### 📝 Key Insight
* **The Universal Algorithm:** As championed by neuroscientist **Jeff Hawkins** (creator of the PalmPilot and Numenta), the most striking feature of the neocortex is its uniformity. The tissue that processes vision looks almost identical to the tissue that processes language. This implies that the brain does not have separate "hardware modules" for seeing vs. hearing. Instead, it runs a single **Cortical Algorithm** (likely **Predictive Coding**) on different data streams. If you plug an optic nerve into the auditory cortex (as done in ferret experiments), the "hearing" tissue learns to "see." Intelligence, therefore, is the ability of this uniform cortical fabric to build a predictive model of whatever input it receives.
