### 💡 Definition
> Endogenous chemicals that enable neurotransmission. They transmit signals across a **chemical synapse** from one neuron (pre-synaptic) to another "target" neuron, muscle cell, or gland cell (post-synaptic).

- **The Classification:** They are generally categorized by their effect on the receiving neuron:
    
    - **Excitatory:** Increases the likelihood of the neuron firing (depolarization).
        
    - **Inhibitory:** Decreases the likelihood of the neuron firing (hyperpolarization).
        
    - **Modulatory:** Adjusts the overall sensitivity of large groups of neurons (neuromodulators).

### 📊 The "Big Five" Arsenal

| **Neurotransmitter** | **Type**       | **The Analogy**        | **Primary Function**                                                                                                     | **Clinical Connection**                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Glutamate**        | **Excitatory** | **"The Gas Pedal"**    | The primary driver of communication. Over 90% of synaptic connections use this. Essential for learning and memory (LTP). | **Excitotoxicity:** Too much kills neurons (Stroke/Seizures).                                                |
| **GABA**             | **Inhibitory** | **"The Brake Pedal"**  | The primary suppressor. It calms neural activity and prevents the system from overheating.                               | **Anxiety:** Benzodiazepines (Xanax) work by boosting GABA to "pump the brakes."                             |
| **Dopamine**         | Modulatory     | **"The Goal Tracker"** | Motivation, Reward Prediction Error, and Motor Control. It signals "This was better than expected."                      | **Parkinson's:** Loss of dopamine motor cells.<br><br>  <br><br>**Addiction:** Hijacking the reward circuit. |
| **Serotonin**        | Modulatory     | **"The Stabilizer"**   | Mood regulation, Sleep cycle, Appetite, and Social Status. It manages the background "tone" of the brain.                | **Depression:** SSRIs (Prozac) work by keeping Serotonin in the synapse longer.                              |
| **Acetylcholine**    | Mixed          | **"The Activator"**    | **CNS:** Attention and Learning.<br><br>  <br><br>**PNS:** Triggers muscle contraction (every move you make).            | **Alzheimer's:** The first neurons to die are often Cholinergic (memory loss).                               |
### 📝 Key Insight
* - **The "Lock and Key" Principle:** The chemical itself is just a key; the _effect_ depends entirely on the **Receptor** (the lock).
    
    - For example, **Acetylcholine** slows the heart rate down (via muscarinic receptors) but makes skeletal muscles contract violently (via nicotinic receptors).
        
    - This explains why one drug can have wild side effects—it is hitting the same "key" in different parts of the body where it unlocks different doors.
        
- **The Balance of Power:** Brain health is largely about the ratio of **Glutamate** (Gas) to **GABA** (Brakes).
    
    - Too much Gas = Seizures/Panic.
        
    - Too much Brake = Coma/Sedation.
        
    - Most general anesthetics work by simply flooding the brain with GABA (slamming the brakes) until consciousness turns off.
