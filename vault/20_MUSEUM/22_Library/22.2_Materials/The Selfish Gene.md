# 📖 The Selfish Gene

**👤 Author:** [[Richard Dawkins]]
**📍 Full Notes:** On reMarkable

---

### 💡 The Core Argument (Thesis)
>[[Evolution]] is best understood from a gene's perspective, viewing organisms as survival machines built by genes to perpetuate themselves, with [[Gene]]s as the fundamental units of selection, selfishly promoting their self replication over the organisms well being, even explaining apparent altruism as gene-level strategies for survival.

### 🧠 Concepts Extracted
*(Concepts linked here will show in Graph View)*
- **Gene-Centered View of Evolution** — Selection acts most fundamentally on genes rather than on organisms or groups.
- **[[Replicator]]** — Entities that copy themselves with fidelity, longevity, and fecundity across generations.
- **[[Survival Machines]]** — Organisms as vehicles built by genes to ensure their own replication.
- **Cumulative Selection** — Small, incremental changes accumulating into complex adaptations over time.
- **[[Kin Selection]]** — Altruism explained by shared genetic relatedness.
- **[[Reciprocal Altruism]]** — Cooperation evolving through repeated interactions and contingent strategies.
- **Extended Phenotype** — Gene effects that extend beyond the organism’s body into the environment.
- **Blind Watchmaker** — Natural selection as a non-intentional designer producing apparent purpose. ([[Non-Teleological Process]])
- **Anti-Teleology** — Rejection of purpose-driven or goal-directed explanations in biology.
- **[[Meme]]** — Cultural replicators subject to selection-like processes.
