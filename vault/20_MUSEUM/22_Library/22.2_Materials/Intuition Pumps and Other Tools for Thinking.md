# 📖 [[Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking]]

**👤 Author:** [[Daniel Dennett]]
**🔑 Zotero Key:** 
**📍 Full Notes:** On reMarkable

### 💡 The Core Argument (Thesis)
>Dennett argues that good thinking depends on using well-designed cognitive tools—especially carefully constructed thought experiments (“[[Intuition Pump]]”)—to discipline intuition, expose hidden assumptions, and replace misleading metaphysical explanations ([[Skyhook]]) with mechanistic, naturalistic understanding ([[Crane]]).

### 🧠 Concepts Extracted
*(Concepts linked here will show in Graph View)*
 - [[Intuition Pump]]— Thought experiments engineered to train intuition rather than prove conclusions.
- **[[Thinking Tool]]** — Conceptual devices (heuristics, distinctions, questions) that improve reasoning quality.
- **[[Skyhook]] vs. [[Crane]]** — Illegitimate “magic” explanations versus stepwise, mechanistic ones.
- [[Competence Without Comprehension]] — Systems can perform intelligently without understanding (key to mind/AI debates).
- **Levels of Explanation** — Distinguishing design stance, intentional stance, and physical stance.
- **[[Reverse Engineering]]** — Explaining complex systems by decomposing functions into simpler mechanisms.
- **[[Free-Floating Rationale]]** — Apparent reasons or purposes that emerge without conscious design.
- [[Meme]] and [[Cultural Evolution]] — Ideas as replicators shaped by selection-like processes.
- **Illusion of the [[Cartesian Theater]]** — Critique of the idea of a single inner observer in consciousness.
- **[[Philosophical Hygiene]]** — Actively cleaning up language and concepts to prevent confusion.
