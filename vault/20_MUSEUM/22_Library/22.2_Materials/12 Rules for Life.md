**👤 Author:** [[Jordan Peterson]]
**🔑 Zotero Key:** **📍 Full Notes:** Printed 12 Rules on Paper!

### 💡 The Core Argument (Thesis)
>Life is inherently defined by suffering and malevolence, a reality grounded in the biological vulnerability of the organism. The only reliable antidote to this suffering is not happiness (which is fleeting), but **meaning**. Meaning is generated when an individual voluntarily accepts responsibility and positions themselves on the border between **Order** (predictability/security) and **Chaos** (potential/danger). By adopting these 12 heuristics—ranging from posture (serotonin regulation) to truth-telling (social cohesion)—the individual strengthens their psychological architecture to withstand tragedy without descending into nihilism or resentment.
