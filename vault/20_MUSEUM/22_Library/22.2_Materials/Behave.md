### 💡 The Core Argument (Thesis)
>Human behavior cannot be explained by a single discipline (e.g., "it's genetic" or "it's cultural"). Instead, every action must be viewed through a **chronological lens of causality**: what happened in the brain one second before (Neurobiology), what happened in the hormones hours before (Endocrinology), what happened in the environment during development (plasticity/epigenetics), and what happened to our ancestors millions of years ago (Evolution). Sapolsky argues that "context is everything"—the same biological signal (e.g., testosterone) can cause aggression or altruism depending on the social scaffolding surrounding the organism.

### 🧠 Concepts Extracted
*(Concepts linked here will show in Graph View)*
* **[[The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)]]:** The "brake system" of the brain. Responsible for executive function, gratification postponement, and doing the "harder thing" when it is the right thing.
- **[[The Amygdala]]:** The ancient sentinel for fear and aggression. It detects threats (and "Them") before the conscious mind perceives them.
- **[[Dopamine]]:** Not the "pleasure molecule," but the **anticipation molecule**. It drives the work required to get the reward, acting as the engine of goal-directed behavior.
- **[[Us vs. Them]]:** A fundamental, evolved cognitive fault line. Humans biologically process "Them" (out-group members) with disgust/threat circuits in milliseconds, though this can be overridden by the PFC.
- **[[Multifactorial Determinism]]:** The rejection of single-cause explanations. Behavior is the output of a complex, interacting system of biology and environment.
