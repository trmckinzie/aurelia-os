# 📖 Waking Up

**👤 Author:** [[Sam Harris]]
**🔑 Zotero Key:** **📍 Full Notes:** On reMarkable

### 💡 The Core Argument (Thesis)
>Spirituality is distinct from religion and does not require unjustified beliefs (faith). Instead, true spirituality is a rational, empirical investigation into the nature of **[[Consciousness]]** itself. The central thesis is that the "Self"—the feeling that there is a distinct thinker behind our thoughts, an ego residing behind the eyes—is a cognitive illusion generated by the brain's default mode network. "Waking Up" refers to the experiential realization (via mindfulness) that the Self does not exist. This insight is not merely philosophical but offers a mechanism to interrupt the feedback loop of psychological suffering.

### 🧠 Concepts Extracted
*(Concepts linked here will show in Graph View)*
- **[[The Illusion of the Self]]:** The core insight that there is no invariant subject in the middle of experience; there is only experience itself.
- **[[Mindfulness]]:** The practice of "paying attention to the present moment without judgment." In this context, it is the laboratory technique used to inspect the mechanics of the mind.
- **[[Split Brain]]:** Evidence from callosotomy patients showing that consciousness can be divided, further dismantling the idea of a unified "soul" or indivisible self.
- **[[Dualism]] vs. [[Monism]]:** The rejection of the idea that mind and matter are separate substances. Harris argues for a reality where consciousness is the primary datum of existence.
- **[[Flow State]]:** A psychological state where the sense of self vanishes during high-performance activities, offered as a "glimpse" of the selfless state accessible through meditation.
