# 📖 Darwin's Dangerous Idea

**👤 Author:** [[Daniel Dennett]]
**🔑 Zotero Key:** 
**📍 Full Notes:** On reMarkable

---

### 💡 The Core Argument (Thesis)
>Dennett argues that Darwin’s theory of [[Natural Selection]] is a powerful, universal [[Algorithm]] that explains the emergence of complex design without foresight, and that taking this idea seriously “eats through” traditional views about [[Mind]], [[meaning]], [[morality]], and [[human exceptionalism]].

### 🧠 Concepts Extracted
*(Concepts linked here will show in Graph View)*
* **Universal Darwinism** — Natural selection as an algorithm applicable beyond biology (e.g., mind, culture).
- **[[Crane]] vs. [[Skyhook]]** — Legitimate step-by-step mechanisms versus illegitimate explanatory shortcuts.
- **Blind Algorithm** — Natural selection as mindless yet capable of generating design-like complexity.
- **Competence Without Comprehension** — Systems can perform intelligently without understanding why.
- **Design Without a Designer** — Apparent purpose arising from cumulative selection, not intention. ([[Non-Teleological Process]])
- **Greedy Reductionism** — Over-simplification that ignores higher-level patterns (a mistake Dennett warns against).
- **Levels of Explanation** — Multiple valid explanatory stances (physical, design, intentional).
- **[[Memetics]]** — Cultural evolution via idea replication and selection. ([[Memes]])
- **Anti-Essentialism** — Rejection of fixed natures in favor of historical, population-based thinking.
- **Dangerous Idea** — Darwinism’s capacity to undermine comforting but unsupported beliefs.
