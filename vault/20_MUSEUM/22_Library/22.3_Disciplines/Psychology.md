# 🧠 Psychology

### 🧐 Definition (The Scope)
>The scientific study of mind and behavior, analyzed as the output of biological information processing. In the **Evolutionary Naturalist** framework, psychology is the bridge between Biology (the hardware) and Sociology (the network). It seeks to reverse-engineer the "software" of the human animal—mapping the algorithms, heuristics, and drives that evolution installed to solve the problems of survival and reproduction. It moves from the "How" of neuroscience to the "Why" of behavior.
>
>In a wider context, psychology serves as the "hub science" connecting social sciences, natural sciences, and the humanities. It investigates the full spectrum of the human condition, including **phenomenology** (subjective experience), **pathology** (mental illness), and **interpersonal dynamics**. While evolutionary approaches focus on _ultimate_ causes (why traits exist), broader psychology often focuses on _proximate_ causes (how environment, culture, and personal history shape an individual right now). This encompasses diverse schools of thought—from Freud’s psychodynamics to Maslow’s humanism—aiming to alleviate suffering and optimize human well-being beyond mere survival metrics.

### 🔑 Core Concepts (The Bricks)
- [[Evolutionary Psychology]]: The understanding that our mental faculties are adaptations—tools forged by natural selection to solve specific ancestral problems (e.g., mate selection, cheater detection).
- [[Cognitive Architecture]]: The structural design of the mind, often modeled as **Information Processing** (Input $\to$ Algorithm $\to$ Output). Includes the distinction between System 1 (Fast/Heuristic) and System 2 (Slow/Rational).
- [[Behaviorism & Conditioning]]: The study of how organisms learn through interaction with the environment via reinforcement (rewards) and punishment (costs). This is the "habit loop" layer.
- [[Neuroplasticity]]: The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life; the mechanism by which "software" updates occur.
- [[Social Influence & Situationism]]: The study of how the immediate environment and group dynamics override individual personality. This covers conformity, obedience to authority (Milgram), and the "Fundamental Attribution Error"—our tendency to blame people's character rather than their context.
- [[The Unconscious & Defense Mechanisms]]: Rooted in Psychodynamics (Freud/Jung), this concept posits that the vast majority of mental activity occurs below conscious awareness. It explores how the mind protects itself from anxiety through mechanisms like repression, projection, and sublimation.
- [[Attachment Theory]]: The foundational model of emotional bonding (Bowlby/Ainsworth). It explains how early interactions with caregivers create "internal working models" that dictate how we trust, love, and relate to others throughout adulthood (Secure, Anxious, Avoidant styles).
- **[[The Big Five (OCEAN)]]:** The most empirically validated framework for Personality Psychology. It moves away from "types" (like MBTI) to measure individuals across five continuous dimensions: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.
- **[[Humanism & Self-Actualization]]:** A counter-weight to the "biological machine" view. Pioneered by Maslow and Rogers, it focuses on the inherent human drive toward growth, meaning, and reaching full potential (Self-Actualization) once basic survival needs are met.

### 📚 Foundational Texts
- [[How the Mind Works]] by **[[Steven Pinker]]** (The Computational Theory of Mind).
- [[Thinking, Fast and Slow]] by **[[Daniel Kahneman]]** (The heuristics and biases framework).
- [[The Principles of Psychology]] by **[[William James]]** (The classic functionalist perspective).
- [[Behave]] by **[[Robert Sapolsky]]** (The synthesis of neurobiology and psychology).

### 🧪 Unresolved Questions
- The "[[Hard Problem]]" of Consciousness: How does subjective experience (qualia) arise from physical neural processing?_
- The interface of Nature vs. Nurture: How exactly does epigenetic expression modulate psychological traits in real-time?
- The limits of Plasticity: To what extent can cognitive architectures be rewritten vs. merely managed?
