# 👤 Sam Harris

### 📝 Profile & Context
> A neuroscientist, philosopher, and podcast host who operates at the bleeding edge of the "Culture Wars" and the "Science of Mind." Harris is the primary architect of **Scientific Morality**—the claim that questions of Good and Evil are actually questions about the well-being of conscious creatures, which can be studied empirically. He combines a ruthless commitment to **Rationality** and **Intellectual Honesty** with a deep interest in the mechanics of meditation. In a **Naturalist** framework, he serves as the "clean-up crew" for religion, stripping away the dogma to reveal the useful psychological software underneath (mindfulness/ethics) while discarding the supernatural hardware.

### ⚛️ Core Concepts
- **[[The Moral Landscape]]:** The idea that there are "peaks and valleys" of human flourishing. Just as there are objective truths about physical health, there are objective truths about psychological/societal health.
- **[[Determinism]]:** The view that thoughts and intentions emerge from background causes of which we are unaware and over which we exert no conscious control. (Direct link to [[Robert Sapolsky]]).
- **[[The Illusion of the Self]]:** The experiential realization that the "Thinker" is a fiction; there is no homunculus in the brain, only a stream of consciousness.
- **[[Conversational Intolerance]]:** The refusal to respect bad ideas. Harris argues that beliefs (especially religious ones) should be open to the same scrutiny as scientific claims.
