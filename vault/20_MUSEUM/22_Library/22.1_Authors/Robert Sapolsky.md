# 👤 Robert Sapolsky

### 📝 Profile & Context
> A Stanford neuroendocrinologist and primatologist who spent decades studying stress in baboons in Kenya. Sapolsky is the arch-determinist of modern biology. He argues that "Free Will" is largely (or entirely) an illusion created by our lack of understanding of the biological machinery driving us. He combines the rigor of **hard neuroscience** with a deep empathy for the human condition, arguing that understanding the mechanics of our behavior shouldn't dehumanize us, but rather make us more forgiving of ourselves and others. He is a primary source for the **Evolutionary Naturalist** worldview.

### 📚 Key Works (In Vault)
* [[Behave]] (The synthesis of his life's work on behavior).
- [[Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers]] (The definitive text on the physiology of stress).
- [[Determined]] (His argument against the existence of Free Will).
- [[A Primate's Memoir]] (His autobiographical account of field work).


### ⚛️ Core Concepts
* **[[The Stress Response]]:** The physiological shift (fight or flight) designed for acute physical crises (running from a lion) that becomes pathological when activated by chronic psychological stressors (mortgages/traffic).
- **[[Biological Determinism]]:** The stance that we are "biological machines" all the way down; there is no "ghost in the machine" acting independently of neurons and hormones.
- **[[Glucocorticoids]]:** (e.g., Cortisol). The primary class of stress hormones that, when chronically elevated, degrade the hippocampus (memory) and suppress the immune system.
- **[[Gene-Environment Interaction]]:** The principle that genes are not "blueprints" but "switches" that are toggled on or off by environmental triggers.
