description: A systematic workflow for initializing and managing new autodidactic projects. It enforces Zimmerman's Cyclical Model to ensure cognitive offloading and avoid passive consumption or AI-dependency.

## 📋 The Sequence

**Phase I: Forethought (The Setup)**

- [ ] **Trigger:** A new topic or project is added to the "Active" stack.
- [ ] **Step 1: The Pre-Mortem (Goal Setting).** Define clearly what "Mastery" looks like for this specific project (e.g., "I can explain this concept to a 5th grader" or "I can build X without looking at the docs"). Ask: _Why might I fail at this?_
- [ ] **Step 2: Strategy Selection.** Choose the specific tools and constraints.
    - _Constraint:_ "I will use NotebookLM to generate the reading list, but I must read the source PDFs myself."
    - _Constraint:_ "I will use the reMarkable for all initial drafting to prevent copy-paste."
- [ ] **Step 3: Self-Efficacy Check.** Rate confidence (1-10) in the chosen strategy. If <7, adjust the scope or increase the resources (e.g., "I need a primer video before the textbook").

**Phase II: Performance (The Deep Work)**
- [ ] **Step 4: The Input/Output Ratio Constraint.** For every 60 minutes of input (Reading/Watching), mandate 15 minutes of output (Synthesizing).
    - _Action:_ Set a timer. When it rings, close the source material.
- [ ] **Step 5: Metacognitive Monitoring (The "Check-In").**
    - _During the session:_ If you feel confused, do not just re-read. Stop and ask: "Is this a vocabulary problem or a logic problem?"
    - _Action:_ Write down the specific confusion point on the reMarkable (e.g., "I don't understand how A causes B").
- [ ] **Step 6: The AI "Tutor" Mode.** Use AI only _after_ you have attempted to solve the confusion yourself.
    - _Prompt:_ "I think X works like Y. Roast my understanding. Where am I wrong?" (Do not ask it to just explain it).

**Phase III: Self-Reflection (The Audit)**

- [ ] **Step 7: The Feynman Test.** At the end of the session/project, attempt to teach the core concept to an empty room or write a simplified note without references.
- [ ] **Step 8: Causal Attribution Analysis.**
    - _If Successful:_ Attribute to **Effort/Strategy** ("I succeeded because I used the timer").
    - _If Failed:_ Attribute to **Strategy** ("I failed because I skipped the prerequisite"), NOT Ability ("I'm too dumb").
- [ ] **Step 9: Adaptive Loop.** Modify the strategy for the next session based on Step 8.

## 🧠 System Logic
> Most self-taught learners get stuck in the **Performance Phase** (endlessly reading/watching tutorials) without ever entering the **Reflection Phase**. This creates the "Collector's Fallacy"—feeling like you know something just because you saved the bookmark.

This protocol forces **Cybernetic Control**:

1. **Forethought** sets the reference value (Goal).
    
2. **Performance** provides the input.
    
3. **Reflection** measures the error signal (Gap between Goal and Result).
    

By strictly attributing failure to _strategy_ (which is fixable) rather than _intelligence_ (which is fixed), we maintain the motivation to iterate (Growth Mindset).
