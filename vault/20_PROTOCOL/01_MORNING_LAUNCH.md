# ⚙️ 01_MORNING_LAUNCH

## 📋 The Sequence

- [ ] Shower, Dress, Brush Teeth, Brew the Coffee
- [ ] Coffee + Daily Log Protocol ("See 02_DAILY_LOG" to see how I read, annotate and take notes, all in a systematic way that continuously builds my digital garden!)
- [ ] Exercise - Lift, Run, Wrestle, Anything

## 🧠 System Logic
> I try and follow at least a rough version of this AM routine everyday. We are creatures of habit, and its best if we build good habits, especially ones that allow us to maintain our health, energy, and well being. At the very least make sure you start your day with some sunlight, hydration, and some movement, this will change your life if you can make it your new normal. If you already have a routine established, that's great, keep it up! Just remember you can always get back on the path of taking care of yourself, even though it often involves sacrificing some forms of pleasure and indulgent self destructive tendencies, but you don't need those anyway, trust me.
