# 🚨 Mission Brief (The Problem)
**System Failure:** The traditional academic literature review process is inefficient, prone to "citation rabbit holes," and lacks a cohesive method for synthesizing hundreds of sources rapidly. **Objective:** Engineer a modern "AI-Augmented" research pipeline to accelerate insight discovery without sacrificing rigorous verification. **The Goal:** Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform semantic synthesis across disparate papers while using hardware tools (reMarkable 2) for deep-focus editing.
# 🛠️ Architecture (The Solution)
**Core Logic:** Designed a multi-modal **Knowledge Synthesis Pipeline** integrating Generative AI with verifying sources. 
- **Discovery Layer:** utilized **Perplexity AI** and **Google Scholar** for semantic search and retrieval of recent peer reviewed papers. 
- **Management Layer:** Aggregated metadata and PDFs into **Zotero** for standardized citation management. 
- **Synthesis Engine:** Ingested source material into **Google NotebookLM** to generate "Audio Overviews" and query specific data points across the corpus. 
- **Drafting Layer:** Exported synthesized insights to **reMarkable 2 Type Folio** for distraction-free, linear editing and final manuscript composition.

# ⚡ Operational Impact (The Results)
**Velocity:** Reduced "Time-to-First-Draft" compared to traditional manual review methods. 
**Synthesis:** Successfully mapped connections between [Self Regulated Learning] and [LLM Usage], an area of research that has very recently picked up traction due to the wide adoption and capabilities of LLMs. 
**Accuracy:** Maintained 100% citation integrity by using Zotero pdfs as the "Source of Truth" while using AI only for summarization. Notebook LM greatly reduces risk of hallucinations, and helps with deep comprehension of source material and scaffolds conceptual clarity across topics.
