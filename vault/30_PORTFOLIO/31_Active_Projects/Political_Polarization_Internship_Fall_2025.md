# 🚨 Mission Brief (The Problem)

In Spring 2025, I was commissioned by **Chris Kam** to investigate strategies for countering political polarization. This initial probe evolved into a comprehensive two-semester study extending into Fall 2025, where I partnered with **Miguel Sanchez**. The goal then was to empirically disentangle the relationship between **Intellectual Humility (IH)** (the buffer) and **Need for Cognitive Closure (NFC)** (the driver) in predicting **Affective Polarization (AP)**, while simultaneously capturing the lived experience of political conflict through qualitative phenomenology. 

# 🛠️ Architecture (The Workflow)

**Core Logic:** Designed an AI augmented research workflow to become well versed in the literature and to add efficiency to the literature review process. Created audio overviews, a mind map, and flashcards on Notebook LM which gamifies and enhances the learning process. 

* **Module A: AI-Augmented Learning (NotebookLM):** I used NotebookLM not to write, but to *understand*. I uploaded my curated Zotero PDFs to generate **Audio Overviews, Mindmaps, and Flashcards**, allowing me to rapidly synthesize complex literature on Moral Foundations and Group Dynamics.

**Search for "IH-NFC-AP" in the digital garden to access these learning materials**  [[IH-NFC-AP]]

* **Module B: Analog Writing (reMarkable 2):** To avoid the temptation of generative AI hallucinations, I wrote the actual manuscript on a **reMarkable 2 Type Folio**. This ensured the cognitive load remained on me, preserving the "human loop" in the creative process.

* **Module C: Knowledge Management (Aurelia-OS):** I established an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. Citations and notes flow from **Zotero** $\rightarrow$ **Obsidian** $\rightarrow$ **GitHub**, automatically deploying to my personal live website (**aurelia-os**) to create a public digital garden of the research.

# ⚡ Operational Impact (The Results)
* **Conference Acceptance:** Research selected for presentation at **RMPA 2026**.

* **Hybrid Workflow Validation:** Successfully demonstrated a research pipeline that integrates AI speed (NotebookLM) with human rigor (reMarkable/SPSS).

* **Manuscript Production:** A polished manuscript (Introduction/Methods) is complete; final results interpretation and discussion are scheduled for Jan-Feb 2026.
# ❓ Why This Research Was Important
* **The "Seizing and Freezing" Mechanism:** Understanding why high-NFC individuals "freeze" on partisan narratives is critical for designing interventions. If parties act as "epistemic providers," we need to know if IH can disrupt that dependency.
* **Methodological Integrity:** In an era of AI, maintaining the integrity of the *writing process* while leveraging AI for the *learning process* is a new frontier in academic research. This project served as a proof-of-concept for this hybrid workflow.
* **Phenomenological Depth:** Quantitative data often misses the "texture" of polarization—the specific feeling of relational rupture. Miguel’s qualitative study fills this gap.

# 👷 What I Did
* **Primary Investigator (Quantitative):** I designed the core study, conducted an extensive literature review (utilizing Google Scholar and Zotero), carried out the recruitment of participants on campus and drafted the manuscript up to the Results section. I am currently preparing to run the final data analysis in **SPSS**.
* **Research Assistant (Qualitative):** I assisted Miguel Sanchez in his qualitative study by conducting a semi-structured interview and performing a **Descriptive Phenomenological Analysis** to extract themes from the transcript. I interviewed 1 of 4 people for his study. 
* **Conference Preparation:** Co-developing the presentation for the **2026 Rocky Mountain Psychological Association (RMPA)** conference in Boise, ID (March 26-28), under the supervision of Chris Kam.
